    "selftext": "There are more than enough ways to handle your configuration lake chezmoi, dotbot, yadm, ansible, salt, org tangle, stow, etc. etc. I get the idea of con.d directories and think it's very useful. But by using this approach every config management, that operates on single files becomes useless. Editing 10 files for one small config change is too much hassle and keeping track which file does what, at least for me, is impossible. If you track your config with git and have to move configs between files, create and delete files frequently it also becomes a hassle. There are lots of programs, that have different files on different locations or multiple programs working together, that a isolated configuration becomes impractical or useless. Lets say you use NetworkManager and iwd. Iwd is somewhat useless without NetworkManager and one change to the first brings changes to the latter with it. This gets even more frustrating if you have a program that requires system wide setup and a user specific setup. There msmtp comes to mind, where I have a default mail for my system, that handles all system related stuff like cronjobs etc. and my private emails for the rest. Here come file permissions to play as changes to the default config in /etc require elevated priveleges but are not needed nor wanted for my user mails, as the file owner will change. I guess ansible and salt could handle this, but may be a bit overkill for the problem at hand. Org-tangle would also work (except the file permissions) and makes documentation easier, as you can just write them in natural language. So how does r/linux handle this problem? P.S. I searched trough this reddit (and other ones), but couldn't find anything. I thought this could be a good discussion, as I recon every linux user has similar needs, but different solutions to this. If this post should violate §1 please just delete it. Edit: There is no right or wrong in the way you do things or the tools you use. They're all equally right as long as it works good for you in the end.",

    "title": "[UPDATE] Vocalinux v0.6.0-beta: 10x faster installs, universal GPU support, and a complete overhaul since v0.2.0-alpha",
    "selftext": "About 3 weeks ago (23 days to be exact) I [posted about Vocalinux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qhogzy/i_built_an_offline_voice_dictation_tool_for_linux/) (v0.2.0-alpha) - an offline voice dictation tool for Linux. The response was amazing, and I've been heads-down coding since then. --- TL;DR: It's now 10x faster to install, works with AMD/Intel/NVIDIA GPUs (not just NVIDIA!), and has a proper GUI. --- ## What's Changed (v0.2.0-alpha -> v0.6.0-beta) ### 1. The Big One: whisper.cpp is Now Default The #1 feedback from the last post was \"this is cool but the 5-10 minute install time kills it.\" Fixed. Switched the default engine from OpenAI Whisper (PyTorch, ~2.3GB download) to **whisper.cpp** (C++, ~39MB model). What this means: - **10x faster installation**: ~1-2 minutes instead of 5-10 minutes - **Universal GPU support**: AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA all work via Vulkan (not just NVIDIA CUDA) - **Better performance**: C++ optimized, true multi-threading, no Python GIL, users all cpu cores. - **Same accuracy**: It's the same Whisper model, just a better implementation. ### 2. Finally Has a Real GUI v0.2.0 was all config files. Now there's an actual GTK settings dialog: - Modern GNOME HIG styling - Choose between 3 speech engines (whisper.cpp, Whisper, VOSK) - Pick your model size (tiny -> large) - Customizable keyboard shortcuts - Language selector (10+ languages) ### 3. Actually Works on Most Distros Now Spent a lot of time on cross-distro compatibility: - Ubuntu/Debian: working - Fedora: working - Arch: working - openSUSE: working - Gentoo/Alpine/Void (experimental): working The installer now auto-detects your distro and installs the right packages. ### 4. Wayland Support That Actually Works v0.2.0 was basically X11-only. Now Wayland is fully supported with native keyboard shortcuts (uses evdev instead of X11 key grabbing). ### Other Improvements - **Interactive installer**: Guides you through setup with hardware detection - **80%+ test coverage**: Much more reliable now - **Better audio feedback**: Smooth gliding tones instead of harsh beeps - **Microphone reconnection**: Auto-recovers if your mic disconnects - **Voice commands**: \"new line\", \"period\", \"delete that\", etc. --- ## What's Still Rough Being honest about the beta: - First run might need you to pick the right audio device - Some Wayland compositors (especially tiling WMs) might need manual setup - Large models (medium/large) need 8GB+ RAM --- ## Looking For Feedback On 1. **Install experience**: Does it work on your distro? How long did it take? 2. **Accuracy**: How's whisper.cpp vs the old Whisper engine for you? 3. **GPU acceleration**: If you have AMD/Intel, does Vulkan work? 4. **Missing features**: What's the #1 thing stopping you from using this daily? --- ## Why I'm Building This I use voice dictation for work (wrist issues) and got tired of: - Cloud services sending my voice data god-knows-where - Windows/macOS having better native options than Linux - Janky scripts that only work in specific apps Goal: Make something that's actually good enough to use daily, 100% offline, and respects privacy. **Website**: https://vocalinux.com **GitHub**: https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux --- *Previous post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qhogzy/i_built_an_offline_voice_dictation_tool_for_linux/* AMA!",

My workstation is purely used for work, so even if I have minor glitches here and there. I cannot justify spending a lot of time troubleshooting, but recently all Chromium based browsers started to crash on video playback. That was a blocker, so I took out my old gdb and pinpointed the problem to… NVidia drivers, to a conflict of the glue layer with the drivers, actually. But nonetheless I bought a Radeon. Crashes were solved. But! Video update latency - gone! Flickering - gone! Wake from sleep issues - gone! Sound problems - gone. OMG!",

If you think this project is mature and useful enough for broader distribution, please let me know whether you believe it’s worth publishing on **Flathub**. Thanks in advance for testing and feedback! ### Credits Most of the reverse engineering work used in this project was not done by me. The majority of the protocol analysis and research was carried out by other open-source projects for various devices, and full credit goes to their contributors. The list of projects and contributors is quite large, so please refer to the Credits section for detailed acknowledgments. I also encourage you to check out their applications and support their work. https://maniacx.github.io/BudsLink/credits ### The Evolution of BudsLink I originally created a simple GNOME extension called Bluetooth Battery Meter to display the battery level of connected Bluetooth devices. Over time, I received several requests to support earbuds with separate left, right, and case battery levels. I eventually managed to add support for AirPods, which led to further requests for Sony and Samsung devices. However, testing GNOME extensions is tedious, as it often requires running a nested GNOME Shell or logging out and back in on the host system. To simplify development and testing, I created a standalone GJS script focused on socket communication and packet encoding/decoding, with a small GUI and code structure aligned closely with the extension so features could be easily ported between them. Later, another user successfully ran the script on a non-GNOME system by installing GJS and libadwaita. At that point, since the script had effectively become a standalone application, I decided to give it a proper GUI—and that’s how BudsLink was born.",

    "selftext": "Fish shell is arguably the best interactive shell on Linux. Fastest startup, the best autosuggestions and syntax highlighting out of the box, zero configuration needed. But it's stayed niche for 20 years because it can't run bash syntax. Every Stack Overflow answer, every README install command, every tool config is written in bash. **Reef** solves this. It's a Rust binary (\\~1.18MB) that intercepts bash syntax in fish and either translates it to fish equivalents or runs it through bash with environment capture. **Three tiers:** 1. Keyword wrappers handle \\`export\\`, \\`unset\\`, \\`source\\` (<0.1ms) 2. AST translation converts \\`for/do/done\\`, \\`if/then/fi\\`, \\`$()\\` to fish (\\~1ms) 3. Bash passthrough runs everything else through bash, captures env changes (\\~3ms) Even the slowest path is faster than zsh's startup time with oh-my-zsh. The migration path from bash/zsh to fish goes from \"spend a weekend rewriting your config\" to \"change your default shell and go back to work.\" ❯ export PATH=\"/opt/bin:$PATH\" # just works ❯ source \\~/.nvm/nvm.sh # just works, env synced to fish ❯ unset MYVAR; echo ${MYVAR:-default} # just works 251/251 bash constructs pass in the test suite. Uses fish's public APIs, doesn't modify fish internals. **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ZStud/reef](https://github.com/ZStud/reef) **AUR:** *yay -S reef* Happy to answer questions or take feedback.

    "selftext": "I’ve been working on an open-source CLI tool called vault-conductor. It’s an SSH agent that retrieves private keys directly from Bitwarden Secrets Manager instead of reading them from the local filesystem. Released under MIT. This was built using the Bitwarden Rust SDK and handles the ssh-agent protocol to serve keys on demand. It supports keys for SSH connections and GitHub commit sign. The design rationale was to eliminate the need for persisting sensitive private key files on disk, which may be recycled across workstations for convenience or, worst, they may be store unencrypted to avoid dealing with passphrases and keychains. Instead, the agent authenticates with Bitwarden Secret Manager, fetches the keys into memory, and serves them to the SSH client. So you key secrets where they belong, your password manager.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, As many other people, I was frustrated by the current behaviour of the caps lock key on Linux as it is different from Windows or Mac OS. If you use caps lock and write fast you can end up with sentences like this : “CAps LOck is not working as intended” There used to be another fix (https://github.com/hexvalid/Linux-CapsLock-Delay-Fixer) but it does not work anymore so I worked on a new one that requires modifying a file in libxkbcommon library. Here is the repo with the instructions to apply the fix : https://github.com/seamisxdev/LinuxCapsLockFix The fix does not currently pass the automatic checks, hence the nocheck flag for the build and I'm sure there is a better way to fix the caps lock issue but at least it is working and it does not interfere with other keys from what I have tested. Feel free to report issues or to propose another way of solving the caps lock issue as it has been a long time issue now on Linux and that the behaviour of a typewriter machine should not dictate the behaviour of a computer just like we would not try to make a car act like a horse.... Anyway, it was a first time for me and I had a lot of fun working on that problem. Enjoy !",

On modern Linux-based desktop systems the compositor typically runs under the same uid as the \"human\" user with the exact same privilleges, so it fundamentally cannot display \"privilleged\" windows (e.g., polkit agent prompts, UAC-style popups). I guess a proper solution would be to run a per-user display server as a system service so that the user never directly owns niether the primary DRM node nor the other input/output devices, which also sidesteps the need to grant the user account direct access to hardware in the first place. That is also different from rootful Xorg because the system service actually has less privilleges than the user itself (e.g., it cannot read the user's home directory).",

    "selftext": "After using Linux for the better part of a decade, I've recently had to start using Windows for work - and one of the things that I've gotten used to really quickly is using my face to log in with Windows Hello. I found a cool solution for this on Linux called [Howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy), which lets you log in with your face in the same way. It works really well, but the annoying part is that Gnome keyring doesn't unlock, so I have to type in my password anyway after reboot. I believe the problem here is that the key used to encrypt and decrypt the keyring is derived from your password, which means biometrics through [Howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy) or [fprintd](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/) won't work to unlock it. Does anyone know if there is any work being done on supporting biometrics for decrypting a keyring? My understanding is that Windows has this set up by generating a random encryption key and storing it in some secure enclave backed by the TPM module. And then setting it up so password, pin, fingerprint, face, etc. can all unlock the secure enclave to retrieve the key for decryption (someone please correct me if I'm wrong here). A lot of modern laptops have TPM now. I know it's also possible to use TPM to, for example, automatically decrypt a LUKS partition. And Linux already has good biometric auth support. Is it possible that we ever see biometric unlocking of TPM secrets in the near future? Is there any ongoing work on this? I'd love to work on this, but it seems like such a feature would require changes in PAM, fprintd, Howdy, keyring, and maybe more.",

So let say you have 10 VPS you want to monitor, you only need to enter it's IP and credentials to start monitoring, that's it. No agent required Features: - Responsive UI on mobile - Start, stop and restart docker containers remotely - Past statistics - Very easy to audit. Files are organized tidily according to each functionalities with straightforward code - Very little backend external dependencies - Easy to install, only docker compose up -d - Very easy to connect to remote machine If this initial release gets a good response, I'll be managing this project long term and add more features in the future Please star the repo if you like it, thanks. https://github.com/Zhoros/Thoramon",

I realized that relying on kernel-level TCP/IP stacks ties agent identity to physical interfaces and IP addresses which breaks mobility so I decided to implement a complete Layer 5 overlay network entirely in userspace that runs over a single UDP socket. The daemon manages a virtual network interface card and handles complex tasks like NAT hole punching and reliable delivery using a custom implementation of sliding windows and AIMD congestion control that I tuned specifically to handle the bursty nature of agent traffic. I handled the IPC layer where the daemon creates a Unix domain socket with mode 0600 to securely multiplex connections from local processes which allows you to run standard HTTP servers over the overlay without root privileges or kernel modules. Any feedback/ideas are greatly appreciated, Thanks.",

Modifiers & Options You can use the following modifiers to customize the behavior of the like command: \\-all, --all, -inf: Show all matching commands (not limited by the default limit). ./like.sh -all git This will display all commands that match the pattern git, regardless of how many results there are. \\-more: Displays results using a pager (such as less) so you can scroll through long output. ./like.sh -more git This is useful when there are many results, so you can easily scroll through them without them scrolling off your screen. \\-i: Perform case-insensitive matching. ./like.sh -i Git This will find git and other variations like Git or GIT without case sensitivity. \\-n \\[NUMBER\\]: Limit the number of results shown to a specific number. ./like.sh -n 10 git This will show only the first 10 commands that match git. Examples of Use Cases: Find Commands by Pattern (e.g., git) If you're looking for all commands related to Git, simply run: ./like.sh git This will list all commands starting with git, such as git, git-log, git-status, etc. Show All Matching Commands To see every command that contains file (including partial matches like file, filemgr, filecopy), run: ./like.sh -all file This will list every command on the system that includes the word file. Case-Insensitive Search If you're unsure whether the command you're searching for is capitalized, use the -i flag: ./like.sh -i Git This will match all variations like git, Git, GIT, etc. Using -more for Long Output If you have many commands that match a search pattern and you want to scroll through them, use -more: ./like.sh -more network Limit the Results If you only want to see the first 5 matching commands, use the -n flag: ./like.sh -n 5 network This will show the first 5 commands that match network. Output Explained Each command will be listed along with a description (if available) pulled from the whatis database. If no description is found, it will display \"no description.\" Example output: git Version control system git-status Show the working tree status git-log Show the commit logs The results are displayed in a numbered list format, with the command name and description aligned neatly. If there are more results than the specified limit, it will show a message like: ... 10 more → use -all to see all",

(I am using Bazzite with KDE) I have been recreating my set up and getting all of the tools and apps that I use on the daily for gaming, content, and development work. I was essentially able to get everything I use on windows with one exception. Elgato doesn't have a version of control center for Linux so I can't control the lights. This pushed me straight into my first development cycle on Linux. I created a simple daemon and controller gui to fill this hole in the ecosystem. I hope to additionally create a plugin from here that will allow these controls to be run on open deck as well. If anyone else uses Elgato lights enjoy! It can either be build from the source code or run as a flatpak.

    "selftext": "I'm happy to announce that Mouse Tiler v5.0.0 for KDE Plasma 6+ has just been released. It is now a highly customizable auto tiler with 16 default auto-tiling layouts to chose from and possibility to create your own. You can do carousel tiling, stacking tiling, a combination of both, fixed location windows, and much more. You can check out all pre-configured layouts here: [https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler/blob/main/AUTOTILERGUIDE.md](https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler/blob/main/AUTOTILERGUIDE.md) (12 of them support multi-monitors - 4 will cause issues for most people (unless you stack your monitors on top of each other)). Remember Window Positions v5.3.0 or higher is required to restore auto-tile status of windows if you want to have your windows auto-tiling across sessions. Auto tiling ALL windows is not recommended at this moment unless you got time to spare and want to see if it works properly. **Support status:** ✅ Multiple monitors ✅ Multiple virtual desktops ✅ Up to 3 auto tiler layouts can be used at once (if you have multiple monitors/virtual desktops, or simply want to switch between different layouts) ❌ Apps that are present on more than 1 virtual desktop (not tested) ❌ Multiple activities (no support planned since my understanding is that this feature is phasing out from Plasma) If you create some awesome layouts, please share them here or on my discord. Also if you encounter some problematic apps there is a channel ( #auto-tiler-problematic-apps ) dedicated to reports so that I can blacklist them in future releases. I will try to create a demo video showcasing some of the layouts and configuration options in a day or two. **Patch notes:** * Added auto-tiling support (16 pre-defined auto-tilers to chose from + ability to create own layouts). Supports carousels and static layouts (or mix of both). * Added setting to change grid tiler background opacity. **Upgrade instructions:** 1. Download in Discover or via same steps as installing below. 2. Make sure to reboot after. **To install the script you can:** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Click the `Get New...` in upper right corner. 3. Search for `Mouse Tiler` (you might have to press Enter twice to find it due some issue with KDE store) and click `Install.` 4. Enable `Mouse Tiler` in previous menu. 5. Click `Apply` to enable it. 6. Click the configure icon to change the settings to your liking. You can also download it from the KDE Store: [https://store.kde.org/p/2334027](https://store.kde.org/p/2334027) The github page can be found here: [https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler](https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler) Enjoy and thank you.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, ​I recently switched from Windows to Linux (currently CachyOS + KDE). I started using Vicinae (the Raycast-inspired launcher), but I found a few gaps in my workflow, so I decided to build my own extensions to solve them. ​ProtonVPN Extension: I got tired of opening the GUI just to toggle my connection. This lets you toggle on/off and see your connection status directly from the launcher. ​Repo: https://github.com/Mujtaba1i/vicinae-protonvpn-extension ​fd-Search Engine: The built-in file search wasn't catching everything on my desktop, so I hooked up fd to handle the indexing. It's incredibly fast, supports thumbnails/icons, and caches to a temp file so it doesn't eat your CPU. ​Repo: https://github.com/Mujtaba1i/fd-Search-vicinae-extension ​I figured other Vicinae users might find them useful too. ​I've submitted a PR to the official store, but you can grab them from my GitHub in the meantime.",

One user (only) notified me yesterday that they were unable to start the desktop on a specific distribution. This is now fixed and it was caused by a missing library file. I have included the missing library file, have tested it and it now starts up like it should. I overlooked this file because Qt5 did not require it but Qt6 does but when I tested the package locally, it worked so it stayed undetected and I tested it on multiple distros. That's all. So to all who tested it but experienced the issue, it is now fixed. If you have further issues, please notify me and I will fix it.",

    "selftext": "Orbitiny Desktop, a Qt/C++ based desktop full of *real* innovations has seen a new release - Orbitiny Desktop Pilot 9. Orbitiny Desktop is a new Qt/C++ desktop environment for Linux built from the ground up using Qt and coded in C++, bringing you *exclusive features* and functionalities *unavailable in other desktop environments*. These features include: *desktop gestures*, *icon emblems* for files on the clipboard (cut or copied), *icon emblems* for *new* and *modified* files, *icon emblems* for empty files and directories, *multi-paste* support, (pasting to multiple selected directories), *dedicated icons* for mounted and user account home directories, *custom desktop directories*, *individual desktop directory per monitor*, *individual desktop directory per virtual desktop* and a lot more! With the release of Pilot 9, the tradition of innovation **continues** and it's bringing you 4 additional unconventional but **productive** functionalities that you don't get to see in other desktops. # 1.0 Pilot 9 - Release Notes: # New Exclusive Features: * **New & Orbitiny Exclusive**: Added an \"**Append to Clipboard**\" option to the right-click context menus. This feature appends the selected file path(s) to the existing ones on the clipboard. If no files are set on the clipboard, it will set them. *So, to make it clear*, it does *not* replace the existing files already set on the clipboard. That one is done when you select \"Copy\". \"**Append to Clipboard**\" *appends* additional file paths to the existing ones already set on the clipboard and then when you select \"Paste\", it just pastes all of them. So unlike selecting \"Copy\" which overwrites previous file paths, \"**Append to Clipboard**\" appends the file paths. If no file paths exist, it will set them. * **New & Orbitiny Exclusive**: Added \"**Paste to Image**\" option to the right-click context menus. This feature appends (vertically) the clipboard pixmap or the file path if it is an image file to the one selected. So it's like the \"**Paste to File**\" option where text context from the clipboard gets pasted into the file (seen first in Orbitiny's initial Pilot 1 Release) but now this functionality is extended and applied to images as well. * **New & Orbitiny Exclusive**: Added an \"**Add to Paste Basket**\" + \"**Paste to Basket**\" options in the right-click context menus. It adds the selected file path(s) to the **Paste Basket**. The **Paste Basket** is a set of destination directories. When you select \"**Paste to Paste Basket**\", the file paths currently on the clipboard will be pasted to each of those directories. If you have selected a mix of directories and non directories only the directories will be added to the \"**Paste Basket**\". * **New & Orbitiny Exclusive**: Added \"**Image Join**\" - Drag one (or more) image files onto another image file and you get an image join menu: \"**Join Images Vertically**\" and \"**Join Images Horizontally**\". Each of the dragged image file will be appended to the target file. # New Applications / Programs: * **New**: Created **Orbitiny Screen/Monitor Configuration** utility to configure and rearrange your monitor positions and screen resolutions (portable and can be used on any desktop environment) * **New**: Created **Orbitiny Desktop Monitor Brightness Control** utility to control your screen brightness on any of your screens (portable and can be used from any desktop environment) * **New**: Created a screenshot capturing utility called: **orbitiny-screenshot-grabber**. Usage: **orbitiny-screenshot-grabber** **/path/to/dir/to/save/screenshot/in** or if left blank, it will be saved in **$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots/**. A subdirectory called **orbitiny-screenshot-grabber** will be created and all file names will be generated automatically in sequential order: 00.png, 01.png, 02.png etc (portable and can be used from any desktop environment). * **New**: Converted the **Orbitiny File Copier** into a separate application so now you can invoke it from scripts and this means you can tell it to copy multiple files and directories to multiple destinations and have a progress bar (portable and can be used from any desktop environment). * **New**: Converted the **Orbitiny File Properties** dialog into a separate application so now you can invoke it from scripts and this means you can pass it a file and it will show you the file properties for that file (portable and can be used from any desktop environment). https://preview.redd.it/1thy6fk61rhg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=695728f714c8878ef188ef41952765e047939798 # New Standard Features: * **New**: Added a toggle/view button to Control Panel to switch between a list view and icon view * **New**: Added Web Browser URL Drag&Drop support to the panel - it allows you to drag URLs from a web browser window to the panel and when so, a launcher button on the panel gets created and when clicked, it takes you to that URL. Note, as it stands, the URL opens in the first detected web browser but soon I will create an option to select the default web browser to use. * **New**: Removed root run restrictions * **New**: (Feature Request): Added support for launching items by pressing the Enter/Return key. Supported applets: Application Menu, Drawer menu, Places Menu. * **New**: (Feature Request): Added support for selecting a search item automatically and then launching it when pressing the Enter key. Supported applets: Application Menu, Drawer menu, Places Menu. * **New**: (Feature Request): Added \"Run as Root\" option in \"**Launcher**\", \"**Quick Launch**\" and \"**Drawer**\" applets. * **New**: Created a Coconut-style coloring to Qutiny's (Orbitiny's File Browser) context menus # Qt / Library Framework Updates: * **Qt**: Ported the entire project to Qt 6.10.1 from Qt 5.15.2 so now Orbitiny is **fully** *up to date* and eventually I will be moving to **cmake**. # Enhancements: * **Enhancement**: Improved X11/Window Buttons **Drag&Drop** functionality * **Enhancement**: Cosmetic changes done to the glass-based themes for the desktop context menus - they are now rounder along with other additional tweaks (Acrylic/frosty themes are planned to be implemented soon so that will be a complete revamp) * **Enhancement**: Restored the \"**Applets**\" submenu in the panel's right-click context menu so this way you can either add applets via the original way or via the global Preferences dialog * **Enhancement**: Decreased the number of annoying messages popping up on the screen when something does not seem right but it gets fixed after OK is pressed. Now, you will only see the message if the issue does not actually get resolved * **Enhancement**: Set the default waiting/delay time for the panel to display a tooltip to 3 seconds. Initially, it looked like tooltips weren't working when you hover over the applet when they actually do but due to incorrect configuration of the timing for the tooltip to appear, it looked like it does not work when in fact it does, it's just that the delay wait time was too long. * **Enhancement**: Brightened up default icons text color on the desktop. Drop-shadow effect looks even better now. * **Enhancement**: Enabled \"**Linux System**\", \"**Disks**\" and \"**Trash**\" icons by default. These should have been enabled by default in Pilot 8 but they were not. * **Enhancement**: Renamed the Orbitiny process guard that watches over the orbitiny-desktop and orbitiny-panel processes for crashes from process-sentinel to **orbitiny-process-sentinel** so if you want to force-end the **orbitiny-desktop** or **orbitiny-panel processes**, you must first end the watcher itself: \"**orbitiny-process-sentinel**\" and then end the others. If you don't do that, the **orbitiny-process-sentinel** process will restart them because it is an infinite loop unless the exit code of the process being watched is 0. When you gracefully exit either the panel, or the desktop, they return an EXIT\\_SUCCESS (0) code so the infinite loops ends and the process being watched won't be restarted. * **Enhancement**: Added a toast message to let you know that the session is being exited when \"Exit\" is selected from the panel. * **Enhancement**: Added toast messages when launching files - this is some nice visual feedback to let you know that your request has been acknowledged. This is contrary to other desktops where when you click a file, *nothing* happens. Click, click, click again, nada, nothing. You don't know if the file-click got processed or whether something happened at all. # Website [https://orbitiny.com](https://orbitiny.com) is now live and all updates will be posted there. I will be creating community forums and migrating the source code repo from Gitea to [**orbitiny.com**](http://orbitiny.com) but that will happen a little later. So yes this means I will be installing a **Gitea** instance on my own but for the time being, [Gitea.com](http://Gitea.com) will do. # Bug Fixes: This log includes all the bug fixes since Pilot 8: * **BugFix**: Fixed an issue with the right-click desktop context menu sometimes not popping up at the first attempt and sometimes the second. * **BugFix**: Fixed a Drag&Drop issue with the Quick Launch applet * **BugFix**: Fixed \"Run in Terminal\" option not obeyed when set in panel's applets options. Note: you can force-run any command in terminal by holding the Alt key (if the Alt key isn't taken by your window manager) * **BugFix**: Fixed a white dot appearing when you right click the desktop to bring up the desktop context menu * **BugFix**: Fixed the dashboard not showing full screen in multi-monitor setup and also going to the wrong screen 300msn (sharp) after it is shown. * **BugFix**: Fixed an issue with applet rearrangement intermittently not working on the panel * **BugFix**: Fixed a crashing bug when you try to access the properties of the Separator applet on the panel * **BugFix**: Fixed a panel crash when the panel is launched on a system whose monitor count is lower than the number of panels per monitor count which is saved in panel's settings. * **BugFix**: Fixed additional panel positioning bugs (significant fixes) * **BugFix**: Fixed a file selection bug with the file manager. When you navigate Up, the directory name in the upper level directory should get reselected and visually it does appear to get reselected but it is actually not and clicking on it still won't select it. The work-around is to select a different file and then reselect it again. This is now all fixed. * **BugFix**: Fixed another file manager crash when the up arrow is clicked in succession * **BugFix**: Fixed gesture trail not showing on the desktop even when turned on. * **BugFix**: Fixed Orbitiny Desktop not exiting properly when run in portable mode (this bug only existed in portable mode, system-wide mode worked fine). * **BugFix**: Fixed Qutiny (The Orbitiny File Manager) crashing when clicking the \"Navigate Up\" arrow on the toolbar repeatedly in succession. * **BugFix**: Fixed theme selection in Control Panel->Appearance not working (and the Appearance app crashing). * **BugFix**: Fixed Unintentional context menu item dragging when you meant to click on the item instead. * **BugFix**: Fixed Orbitiny-Panel positioning bugs (going to the wrong screen etc) * **BugFix**: Fixed Qutinty (File Browser) crashing bug when navigating. This got introduced in Pilot 8 while trying to fix another bug. Pilot 8B has both of them fixed. * **BugFix**: When you Drag&Drop a file to the panel, if the active icon theme currently does not have an icon pixmap associated for that file type, there won't be a launcher icon displayed (it will be blank). I have now fixed that and added a default fall-back icon in case the icon theme does not provide the icon pixmap. So you will never have a blank icon anymore. * **BugFix**: Fixed an installation issue on some systems depending on the system's configuration * **BugFix**: Fixed an unintentional session-quit - intermittently, the desktop window would gracefully exit (not crash) upon double-clicking on a desktop directory. * **BugFix**: Fixed an unintentional and intermittent session-quit with the panel too but this one only occurred after a system-boot when Orbitiny first starts. Are there more bugs? Probably...Yes, if you report them to me, I will fix them. Also, frosty / acrylic windows like the ones you see elsewhere are coming. The best is yet to come. Project website: [https://orbitiny.com](https://orbitiny.com) Subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbitiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbitiny/) YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/@Orbitiny-Linux](https://www.youtube.com/@Orbitiny-Linux) Source code: [https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop](https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop) (As usual, Pilot 9 code will be ready in a few hours from this post) Download: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/) I just want to mention again, if you find something does not operate as described here, you need to tell me so I can fix it. People that have communicated with me know that I am very responsive, I respond to user reports, requests etc. At the same time, I ask for understanding, this is a large project and it is very tough managing it all by myself but nonetheless, I can do it. P.S Orbitiny Desktop was started in 2017 with a blank form/widget. It now has over 50 components.",

On a forum I received an in-depth reply that Microsoft is rapidly upgrading their 365 Office suite and breaking compatibility. I thought this \"war\" around formats was already \"won\" when DOCX and XLSX etc were standardized, but apparently it's only \"half a standard\" or something so people are still forced to Office because of formats. Any thoughts?",

Browser tabs with live feeds are distracting. You just want to know when something happens or quickly catch up at the end of your day. **The solution:** Keep it running in a tmux pane. Get notified. Check details when you want. Stay in your terminal. Built in Go. Works everywhere (macOS/Linux/Windows). **Quick Install:** `brew install 0xjuanma/tap/golazo` https://github.com/0xjuanma/golazo If you're a football fan who lives in the terminal, give it a spin.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I was thinking about something lately and I’m curious about the community’s opinion. On Windows/macOS, there’s a growing focus on continuity between devices: syncing, notifications, file sharing, clipboard, messaging, remote control, etc. On Linux we already have great tools (KDE Connect, GSConnect, Syncthing, Nextcloud, etc.), but they often feel like separate pieces rather than a fully integrated “ecosystem”. So my question is: Do you think Linux would benefit from a more unified desktop + mobile experience? For example: Native integration between phone and PC Seamless file/clipboard sharing Better app continuity Unified account/sync system (optional, self-hosted, privacy-respecting) We have projects like Plasma Mobile, Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish, and great desktop environments, but nothing that really feels “end-to-end” yet. Is this something you’d like to see more focus on? Or do you think Linux’s strength is exactly in being modular and decentralized? Curious to hear your thoughts.",

    "selftext": "**Edit**: Thanks for all the comments and upvotes. For those who may be concerned with AI-generated codes in the repo, I honestly did not know that people would be so against it. Therefore, I've decided to do a complete rewrite of the repo manually from scratch using my most familiar and favorite language, Java. So please do not just dismiss this project as an \"AI slop\" yet, I guarantee you I may have used AI but there's real passion and thoughts involved. Also, lots of comments have accused me of writing my comments/posts in AI, but that is absolutely false. I wholly admit I used AI heavily for the project, but I've written all the comments and posts myself. I hope you believe me. Please do not think I would have used AI for everything just because I used AI for the repo. :( Hello r/linux, As you know, it's always plenty of pain for moving large files between devices. While there are equally plenty amount of other CLI-based (or UI only) file sharing tools out there, I wanted to tackle the challenge myself. After researching and playing around with some popular tools, I started to ask these fundamental questions (Of course, correct me if I'm wrong): **- Why is there no popular mainstream p2p CLI tool that uses QUIC(UDP) protocol?** **- Why are there no p2p CLI tool that supports multiple receivers?** **- Why do most p2p CLI tools fall short of scp/rsync in terms of throughput?** **- Why do most p2p CLI tools treat multi-file, multi-directory transfers as a second-class case?** **- Why don't most p2p CLI tools not expose low transport-level configuration and tuning parameters that may be essential for special networks?** In order to address these questions, I wanted to design a toolkit that would make mass file sharing fast, simple, and flexible for everyone at no cost. The name is **Thruflux**, and I had one goal in mind : Maximize throughput without sacrificing ease of use. Over the past months, I worked on this tool to make moving large sets of files between arbitrary machines simpler and faster, most importantly without requiring SSH, servers, or port forwarding. I pondered over what languages to use, and at the end I decided to use either Go, Rust, or C++ in order to \"juice out\" the performance. However, I was quite unfamiliar with all three languages at the time, so I decided to learn Go (as it is arguably the easiest to learn out of three) and also receive some help from AI to engineer my ideas faster. The result is a cross-platform CLI written in Go that uses direct peer-to-peer transfers over QUIC, with automatic NAT traversal and relay fallback when needed. A single sender can serve multiple receivers concurrently, and directory transfers are handled natively, file-to-file without any compression/decompression. To experiment, I recently benchmarked it against scp, rsync, croc, and magic-wormhole to understand the tradeoffs more clearly. While it doesn’t always beat built-in infrastructure tools like scp/rsync in ideal conditions, it gets surprisingly close while solving a harder problem (zero-setup P2P), and transfer speeds shows much lower variance than single-stream TCP tools. Moreover, thruflux consistently outperformed comparable P2P CLI tools, particularly for multi-file transfers. The project is open source and still evolving - I'm happy to hear feedback, especially from people who move a lot of data around. My vision is to create a free, secure, fast mass file sharing CLI tool that is (hopefully and eventually) achieves throughputs close to infrastructure tools like scp/rsync, which many current p2p file transfer CLI tools out there fall short of. While clearly I'm not someone with vast amount of networking knowledge, I'm just a student who is curious and passionate about the file sharing experience. I've poured many thoughts and taken many measures into how to make this possible, and now I believe I have reached a point where I would like to invite some early users to try out the tool. I'd really appreciate if anyone who needs some data moved try out my tool. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I still have a lot to learn and would really appreciate any feedback, challenges, or insights. I really hope that one day this tool can be useful to someone and help solve a real problem.

The *bare minimum* basic experience is... pretty good actually! but I've **been** struggling for the past two weeks with various nitpicks. The laptop came preinstalled with Ubuntu - I hated the top bar and could not get it removed. Friend suggested Kubuntu--could not get CS2 to work; moved to Zorin--got completely different sets of annoyances. But the most pain-inducing part for me so far has been managing my SSD so the data stays intact between reinstalls (as from what I've seen so far every distro annoys you in its own way), and working out how to get games (especially old games) which come with their own proprietary launcher to work. Windup's too long--my question is: for those of you who experienced Linux 15-20 or more years ago, how does it compare? With old Linux i have the image of something completely unusable 'out the box'.",

Thus I recently wrote a little tool to help with that: [den](https://github.com/codesoap/den). With `den track ~/Documents` or `den track ~/Media` you can add files to its database and then, e.g. list documents, sorted by their modification date with `den document | fzf --no-sort` or pictures with `den picture | fzf --no-sort`.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone from r/linux! Coming from years in the dark side of windows, I've always used GUI heavy tools for exploring and managing databases (namely SMSS, and more recently Datagrip). These tools are great and extremely capable, but they definitely feel a little too \"heavy\" when all I was doing was running simple select queries against my tables. After switching to Linux (ubuntu > mint > arch > nixos what a journey lol), I found myself switching more and more to CLI/TUI tools. Right now my editor, file explorer, vpn manager and ai tools all live in the terminal, but one thing I could never fully switch was my database manager (using dbeaver on linux). I've tried a few TUI focused tools, but although they feel and run great (harlequin, sqlit, rainfrog), they feel very similar in design to other GUI tools (with the 3 pane setup - explorer, editor and results views). That's when I started experimenting and working on pam, using an alternate approach. Pam's Database Drawer uses a hybrid approach between being a cli and tui tool: cli commands whenever I can (managing connections and queries, switching contexts), TUI where it makes more sense (exploring results, interactive updates), and your $EDITOR when... editing text (usually for writing queries). This is my attempt (although flawed) to use the UNIX philosophy: a tool that does one thing well, and relies on other tools to make it better. Here's the repo with install and usage instructions: [https://github.com/eduardofuncao/pam](https://github.com/eduardofuncao/pam). There's a gif in the post header with a demo run as well Built with go and the awesome charm/bubbletea! Currently already supports sqlite, postgres, mysql/mariadb, sqlserver, oracle and more (check repo). Currently in beta, so any feedback is very welcome! Especially on missing features or database adapters you'd like to see. Please let me know what you think of it and if it would benefit your current workflow using linux and dealing with databases. Thanks a lot!",

    "title": "Zena new ISO RELEASE!🎉",
    "selftext": "Hello Linux Users!, I wanted to share some significant updates that have just landed with the latest Zena ISO release. This isn’t just another incremental change it feels like the system has matured in some really meaningful ways, especially if you’ve been following along. First up, the package manager, **Zix**, has been reworked. It now supports multiple profiles, which has completely changed how I manage software. You start with a default setup, but you can create profiles like one for web development, another for writing, whatever you need, and install packages specific to each. Switching between them is seamless. If you have an existing setup, migrating is straightforward. On the virtualization front, setting up a VM is now drastically simpler. A new command handles the entire process, pulling in all the necessary tools inside a dedicated container. It does ask for your sudo password a few times during the process. I’m planning to smooth that out soon but the convenience is already a huge step forward. The desktop experience has received some thoughtful polish. Theming for GTK Flatpak apps is now much more consistent with DMS, so applications look like they truly belong. I’ve also set **Papirus** as the default icon theme. It complements DMS’s visual style really well, giving everything a cleaner, more unified feel without feeling over-designed. A couple quality-of-life changes make daily use noticeably smoother, the greeter and Niri no longer display any flashing text on startup, and the login screen now automatically syncs the wallpaper and config from your last session or any last logged in user. It’s a small touch, but it makes the system feel more cohesive. Overall, this release focuses on making Zena more modular, more consistent, and easier to live with. If you’ve been curious or waiting for a good time to try it out, I think this is it. You can grab the new ISO from the project page below. As always, I’d love to hear what you think.

That website might be a little hard to parse though - so here are are some links: * you can check it out on video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBT9XO61B5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBT9XO61B5I) (I usually do a short intro on every development livestream) * GitHub is here: [https://github.com/mafik/automat](https://github.com/mafik/automat) * an article about Automat: [https://automat.org/live2025](https://automat.org/live2025) (if you have any questions - check this out first!) * and the Steam page is here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122050/Automat/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122050/Automat/) While Steam version is still in “coming soon” mode, you can grab a release from [GitHub](http://github.com/mafik/automat/releases/latest). Please note that even though it's free on GitHub, Steam Wishlists are still important for visibility - this is what drives the Steam algorithm! The easiest way to help out is to hit the wishlist button :P One word of warning - it doesn’t play well with Wayland (it’s fairly hard to interop with other apps on Wayland) - but I’m optimistic about this bit in the near future... And finally - don't be fooled by it's seemingly game-oriented focus. At it's core it's a visual programming environment!",

    "selftext": "We open-sourced a modern and multi-platform memory bandwidth and latency benchmarking tool designed to work without manual tuning: [https://github.com/spareCores/sc-membench](https://github.com/spareCores/sc-membench) **Feature highlights:** * Comprehensive tests across read, write, copy, and latency (pointer chasing) workloads * Multi-platform (e.g. evaluated on multiple x86 and arm64 machines), portable (e.g. tested on BSD), and easy to run via Docker * Efficient multi-threaded measurements via OpenMP * Optimal thread placement and memory allocation for NUMA systems * Adaptive test sizes based on CPU cache amounts * Automatically handles Transparent Huge Pages **Disclaimer:** Yes, we used LLMs for both coding and documentation updates, but we carefully validated the results against existing tools and their shortcomings. The results look super promising so far, and we already got some encouraging early feedback from our direct network, so it's time to ask for scrutiny from the wider community /o\\\\ **Motivation:** We previously benchmarked 3,000+ cloud server types using `bw_mem` from LMbench, but the results were not always consistent with the detected L1/L2/L3 cache sizes. Debugging identified both cache detection issues (mostly relying on `lscpu`, investigating `lstopo` now), and limitations of `bw_mem` as well, e.g. unexpected slowdowns on servers with 100+ vCPUs. See more details in the \"Comparison with lmbench\" section of the README. **Why does your feedback matter?** We plan to run this across \\~5,000 cloud server types of 7 vendors, so I'd highly appreciate your feedback on methodology, implementation correctness, example results, and any missing cases before burning through a lot of precious cloud credits :) The results will also be published under open-source licenses, just like all other data we collect at Spare Cores (including a bunch of other benchmark results).",

InfiniPaint is a collaborative, infinite canvas note-taking/drawing app. The biggest distinguishing feature of this application is that **there is no zoom in or zoom out limit.** Other than that, InfiniPaint's features include: * Open online lobbies for collaboration * Text chat with others in the lobby * Jump to the location of other players through the player list * See other members draw in real time * Although this is a feature, you can also choose to completely forget about it. This app can be used offline * Graphics tablet support (Pressure sensitive brush and eraser detection) * Layers with blend modes and opacity. Layers can be sorted into folders with their own blend mode and opacity * Save/load projects * Saveable color palettes * Quick menu usable by right clicking on the canvas, which can be used to: * Quickly change brush colors using the currently selected color palette * Rotate the canvas * Place bookmarks on the canvas to jump to later. Bookmarks can be sorted into folders * Undo/Redo * PNG, JPG, WEBP export of specific parts of the canvas at any resolution (Screenshot) * SVG export of specific parts of the canvas (Screenshot) * Transform (Move, Scale, Rotate) any object on the canvas (Rectangle Select Tool/Lasso Select Tool) * Display Images and animated GIFs on the canvas * Note: May take a lot of memory to store and display images compared to other objects, especially GIFs * Hide (or unhide) the UI by pressing Tab * Remappable keybinds * Create custom UI themes * Place infinite square grids on the canvas as guides for drawing * Grids come with various properties, including changing color, and displaying coordinate axes * Textbox tool with formatting support (Bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, overline, fonts, text color, highlight color, text size, paragraph alignment, text direction) * Other tools: Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Eye dropper/color picker, Edit/cursor * Can copy/paste selected objects (Ctrl-C Ctrl-V). This can also be done between different files, as long as they're open in different tabs in the same window InfiniPaint is a native application written in C++ and licensed under the MIT License. You can find the source code on Github at: [https://github.com/ErrorAtLine0/infinipaint](https://github.com/ErrorAtLine0/infinipaint) The best way to download this application for Linux is to get it on Flathub at: [https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.infinipaint.infinipaint](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.infinipaint.infinipaint) . You could also download a single file flatpak bundle at the main download page: [https://infinipaint.com/download.html](https://infinipaint.com/download.html) You can try a (slightly restricted) version of InfiniPaint in your browser at: [https://infinipaint.com/try.html](https://infinipaint.com/try.html) (requires a WebGL2 capable browser, designed for desktops, and might take a while to load)",

If not: `sudo apt install spice-vdagent` **## Check QEMU Guest Agent ###** `dpkg -l | grep qemu-guest-agent` If missing: `sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent` `sudo systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent` *!This does not directly fix display or mouse issues, but is recommended.* \\-------------------------------------------------\\[ # **FIX** \\# \\]-------------------------------------------------- \\## Issues overview \\#1.

XFCE and MATE often misinterpret this, making the cursor and clicks misaligned. *> This problem is not unique to Kali and occurs on several distros with SPICE + KVM/QEMU.* **1. Power off your VM** **2. List your VM:** `sudo virsh --connect qemu:///session list --all` **3. Edit VM XML** `sudo virsh --connect qemu:///session edit VM_NAME` **4. In the section,** ***delete the tablet line***\\*\\*:\\*\\* `` **5. Make sure the VM use a PS/2 mouse** `` **6. Save, ctrl+o send ctrl+x** Restart the vm. Hope this guide helped!

    "selftext": "Hi, like I said in the title, Im trying to make Bash easier to understand for everyone by developing a solution using visual scripting (UE5 inspired). This project is for fun so its made Python and Qt, I believe this project could have a good educational purposes and making Bash more 'friendly'. I have already made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qbzcjr/making_visual_scripting_for_bash/) for this project and everyone gave so many idea and tweaks to help me (and I would thanks everyone for that). So I have implemented some of them like tool-tips and highlights.. Moreover, Im trying to make the code \"easier to fork\" (sorry I don't have the right word for it), if someone wants to fork the project and making his own version, some things are already easy to implement like adding new nodes is quite simple. I plan for the future to make like the \"reverse\", import a Bash script and convert into nodes but right now Im focusing on making nodes and then having the Bash code. Also I have some questions for you, would you use such a project ? Would a wiki on GitHub on how to use the tool (and how the code works) be useful ? And finally, the icon im using are from [here](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), can i use them in my project ? (im already citing them in my credits but Im wondering) Im leaving the repo link for anyone who wants to see more about Its made, remember this is WIP: [https://github.com/Lluciocc/Vish](https://github.com/Lluciocc/Vish)",

    "selftext": "**First, let’s look at the problem from the point of view of a hardware reviewer on YouTube or a review website** Anyone who has watched the old GamersNexus video on Linux performance testing will remember that hardware reviewers, especially on YouTube, rely on very specific and tightly controlled software environments on Windows. They want predictability. A typical setup might be a system running Windows 11 24H2, which is not even the latest release at this point in time, with updates disabled and the machine disconnected from the internet, using only the drivers provided by the hardware manufacturer. For reference testing, they need stability, not in the sense of being bug free, but in the sense of being static. This allows results to be reproduced reliably over time. **Where Linux falls short** Many Linux distributions intentionally ship older kernels and older versions of Mesa. This becomes a real problem for newer GPUs that rely on open source drivers, such as Intel Arc. For example, running Ubuntu 24.04 on an Intel Arc card can result in usability or performance issues that have already been resolved in more updated distros, such as the latest fully updated Fedora release. **The idea of a “Benchmark Linux”** The core idea revolves around immutability. This would not be a general purpose Linux distribution meant for daily use. Its sole purpose would be benchmarking. To be useful for reviewers, it would need the following characteristics: * A completely static environment with no package updates. When the system is updated, everything is updated together, kernel, Mesa, and all other components, as a single versioned image. Probably monthly, Probably Quarterly. The reviewer must be able to point to \"Benchmark Linux 2026.FEB\" in their graph and that must point to a specific kernel/mesa version. * Inclusion of both open source and proprietary benchmarking tools and utilities benchmarkers expect to use, Steam being an obvious example. It may also be possible to work with vendors of proprietary benchmarks to allow redistribution. * A modern desktop stack that uses current GPU features, such as KDE on Wayland. (I believe, modern GPUs like Intel Arc are prioritizing Wayland over X11 not that performance should be that much different for people using X11) * Optional support for a modern VR and OpenXR stack, as VR is likely to become more relevant to linux in the near future with Steam Frame. * A separate Nvidia image that includes the latest Nvidia drivers available for that release cycle(we need that sadly as most people just use Nvidia sadly) * Must be completely unopinionated in regards to optimizations. No -O3 no specialized AMD64-v4 images or anything like that.",

While I am not fluent in C++ (I am fairly fluent in other things), I can write a decent bug report/feature request and I try to do this often. While not all my reports/requests get solved, when they do life gets a little bit better. I encourage others to take the time to make our open source world a better place by filing more bug reports/feature requests; it can even be something simple and you never know when someone might just want to scratch an itch and resolve a bug/implement your request: [https://bugs.kde.org/show\\_bug.cgi?id=513987](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513987) Thank you Allen!",

I want to present my creation, namely The Snap Sideloader, a graphical program that can not only be used to install snap packages stored locally, but also to install them from third party repositories. The user can add as many third party repositories as they want, and switch between them at will. They can browse the repository, search for programs in the repository and view program details, as well as install/uninstall programs from the repository. Repository creation is not hard, anyone can do it. Obviously you will have to find a place to host your package files, as well as the icons and screenshots. Afterwards, you can create a SQLite database from the schema that is available on GitHub, so that it has a structure compatible with The Snap Sideloader, and then you can start filling in the data. Once you're done with filling in the database, host it somewhere and make the direct download link available, as users will need that link to add the repository into the client. As long as the download link stays the same, TSS will be able to download any updates made to it automatically at the start of the program, depending on what the set refresh interval is. I am not going to tell you that this is feature complete, while the program does count how many updates are available for the installed packages, it doesn't give you an option to install them all, so an user would have to manually go to the program's page and do that. But the base is definitely there and this is just to prove that you can distribute snap packages outside of the Snap Store, unlike what people are usually saying. It might take more effort if you want to do it, but with the help of programs like The Snap Sideloader you can create your own repositories of snap packages. F-Droid was my inspiration when creating this program. Think of it more as a concept that someone else could certainly execute better. Perhaps there isn't a huge interest in something like this, but I think that on something like Ubuntu Core Desktop, the ability to access third party snap repositories would probably be more valuable, so maybe it's a thing for the future. In either case, if you're interested in reading more and you want to play with the program or check out the source code, you can visit this GitHub page: [https://github.com/thetechdog/the-snap-sideloader](https://github.com/thetechdog/the-snap-sideloader) Don't expect updates to The Snap Sideloader, as I probably won't add anything major, but if anyone wants to expand on the idea and make it better, you're more than welcome to do so! Thank you for your interest.",

These tools are useful if you already know Bash’s resolution rules, but they don’t show the entire resolution chain or make it obvious why a specific command wins.

I started developing it because I wanted some niche features that I could not find in others, and also wanted it to be minimal and not reduce screen real-estate. Its still in alpha, I'm open to suggestions, feature requests etc.",

    "title": "Are you worried about the shift away from x86?",
    "selftext": "**Edit**: This post is about the incompatibility issue between kernel's communication with hardware in ARM computers, which isn't an issue in x86. During the era of early computing, when 8-bit and 16-bit computers were the norm, there was an issue with computers being incompatible with each other. Even the systems that had exactly the same processor models, like Apple II and Commodore 64, or Amiga and Macintosh, were so different architecturally that they required separate ports of programs or third-party operating systems like CP/M and later, Linux. On x86, we are very lucky for computers to be mostly compatible in each other, because they were designed around compatibility with the IBM PC, which later evolved into the Wintel architecture we have today. Unlike on ARM or RISC-V, on x86 you have standards that allow you to boot any operating system without making special changes, unlike on ARM. You can display graphics, get input from keyboard and mouse, play audio and use USB and Ethernet ports by using standard APIs every x86 computer implements. In contrast, on ARM and RISC-V you have to have a specific image for your computer or a device, because there's no fallback you can rely on unlike on x86. Are you afraid of risk of returning to the past, where running Linux was difficult on anything that wasn't x86 with the decline of the architecture?",

    "selftext": "So tablets have two issues here. One is that each device seems to have its own location saved and the pointer teleports to it when it switches back from the tablet to the mouse (But not the other way around???) and this behavior gets EXTREMELY shitty when both are sending signals at once. Think a dragon ball z fight, pointer teleporting spastically all over the screen at the speed of the polling updates. The second is the pointer moves slower with the tablet, significantly so, to the point that I need to drag my pen across the whole tablet several times over to get from a corner to the other in a 1920x1080 screen. While I still haven't found a fix for the teleporting issue (Maybe multicursors would remove that factor? Still haven't dug into it) the speed was easy enough to fix using help from [this post](https://discuss.kde.org/t/how-to-access-libinput-properties-in-wayland-for-an-external-touchpad/11730/2). I went to the apropriate event folder and set pointerAcceleration to 1, which I think makes the tablet use the same settings as the mouse. I didn't find any property to set a custom one, but this works well enough for me. Since it's more complicated than the qt dbus explorer and I'll probably come looking for this in the future myself and want to script it, and it took me a minute to figure out how the command works, the way to get the property via the command line is busctl --user get-property org.kde.KWin /org/kde/KWin/InputDevice/event4 org.kde.KWin.InputDevice pointerAcceleration where event4 changes depending on the device number per the output of sudo libinput list-devices. It can probably get grepped and scripted easy enough, but I haven't tried myself yet.",

    "selftext": "Greetings everyone, It’s been a few months of on-and-off work on [PCIem](https://github.com/cakehonolulu/pciem), a Linux-based framework that enables in-host PCIe driver development and a bunch of other goodies. It kinda mimicks KVMs API (Albeit much more limited and rudimentary, for now) so you can basically define PCIe devices entirely from userspace (And they’ll get populated on your host PCI bus!). You can basically leverage PCIem to write state machines (It supports a few ways of intercepting the PCI accesses to forward them to the userspace shim) that define PCI devices that \\*real\\*, \\*unmodified\\* drivers can attach to and use as if it was a physically connected card. You can use this to prototype parts of the software (From functional to behavioural models) for PCI cards that don’t yet exist (We’re using PCIem in my current company for instance, this is a free and open-source project I’m doing on my free time; it’s by no means sponsored by them!). Other uses could be to test how fault-tolerant already-existing drivers are (Since you ‘own’ the device’s logic, you can inject faults and whatnot at will, for instance), or to do fuzzing… etc; possibilities are endless! The screenshot I attached contains 2 different examples: Top left contains a userspace shim that adds a 1GB NVME card to the bus which regular Linux utilities see as a real drive you can format, mount, create files… which Linux attaches the nvme block driver to and works fine! The rest are basically a OpenGL 1.2 capable GPU (Shaderless, supports OpenGL immediate and/or simple VAO/VBO uses) which can run tyr-glquake (The OpenGL version of Quake) and Xash3D (Half-Life 1 port that uses an open-source engine reimplementation). In this case, QEMU handles some stuff (You can have anything talk to the API, so I figured I could use QEMU). Ah, and you can run Doom too, but since it’s software-rendered and just pushes frames through DMA is less impressive in comparison with Half-Life or Quake ;) Hope this is interesting to someone out there!",

    "title": "Mouse Tiler v3.0.0 update available! Revolutionizes how you tile!",
    "selftext": "# Existing users might need to manually update (bug in KDE Discover since about a week back - see update instructions below) I'm happy to announce that Mouse Tiler v3.0.0 for KDE Plasma 6+ has just been released. It changes how you use a tiler by adding **Center In Tile** (Meta+Ctrl+C) - a feature I have always wanted myself (I want to use it almost daily, but had to move the window manually until now). **Center In Tile** lets you center your current window in any tile - without changing it's current size. Perfect for when you want to move a window to the middle of the screen or anywhere you need it. A graphical tile web editor is coming next week, link is already included in settings for an early preview. Expected to have a fully working editor around Wednesday 21st of January. **New in this update:** * Added new operation mode, Center In Tile. When enabled, the currently moved window will be centered in the tile without changing size. To center in tile, use the shortcut: Meta+Ctrl+C or change the default settings. * Added support for absolute pixel values in Overlay Tiler. Added support for anchor point using the format: \\[X,Y,Width,Height,AnchorX,AnchorY\\] * Example: * 50,50,320px,240px,CENTER,CENTER - places a 320x240 pixels large tile in the middle of the screen * 100,100,50,25,RIGHT,100 - places a 50% wide, 25% high tile in the lower right corner of the screen * Valid values for AnchorX: 0-100, LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT * Valid values for AnchorY: 0-100, TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM * It is now possible to show position and size hint for regular tiles in Popup Grid mode. **To update (if the update does not show in Discover):** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Delete the script (your settings won't be deleted), follow steps below to install it again then reboot to apply the update. **To install the script you can:** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Click the `Get New...` in upper right corner. 3. Search for `Mouse Tiler` (you might have to press Enter twice to find it due some issue with KDE store) and click `Install.` 4. Enable `Mouse Tiler` in previous menu. 5. Click `Apply` to enable it. 6. Click the configure icon to change the settings to your liking. You can also download it from the KDE Store: [https://store.kde.org/p/2334027](https://store.kde.org/p/2334027) The github page can be found here: [https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler](https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler) Enjoy and thank you.",

This will not only affect i586 and armv7 platforms, but also x86\\_64 where in many places 32-bit ints are used to keep track of UNIX time values. [LWN wrote about it](https://lwn.net/Articles/938149/). This is not just theoretical. By setting the build system clock to 2038, I found many failures in builds and testsuites of our openSUSE packages: * (fixed) [cmake had a test failure](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/27263) because of [an issue in libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/2742) * (fixed) it can screw [your uptime](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/-/issues/362) * break [mercurial](https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6778) * fail [zope/ZEO](https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZEO/issues/245) * affect [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32429) * fail [gcc14 compilation](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1223169) * [django-graphql-jwt](https://github.com/flavors/django-graphql-jwt/issues/318) * [python-stdnum](https://github.com/arthurdejong/python-stdnum/issues/431) * (fixed) [rmw](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/issues/439) * (fixed) [wxWidgets](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/24414) * (fixed) [libzypp](https://github.com/openSUSE/libzypp/issues/559) * [python-3.12](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124851) * (fixed) [python-exiv2](https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/python-exiv2/issues/44) * (fixed) [ccache](https://github.com/ccache/ccache/issues/1524) * (fixed) [taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/pull/3052) * and many more Additionally, some protocols like SOAP/XML-RPC and SNMP use 32-bit values, so implementations have to be smart in how they transport timestamps. The underlying issue is that 0x7fffffff aka 2147483647 is the highest value that can be stored in a signed 32-bit integer value. And `date -u -d @2147483647` tells you when that will roll over. I think, some distributions already started to compile their 32-bit code with `-D_TIME_BITS=64 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64` but that is only part of the solution. Code that handles timestamps regularly gets added or rewritten and every time, developers need to remember to not use `int` there (nor `long` on 32-bit systems) but `long long` or `int64_t` or just `time_t`. I myself sent PRs in the past using `atol` for timestamps. We should not do that anymore. same for `scanf(\"%l\")`. I opened a [discussion with the gcc devs](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=118326) about adding warnings for int=>time\\_t conversions. It did not yet get very far, but at least a colleague at SUSE made a PoC patch and identified some corner cases.",

    "selftext": "I just released version 5.2.0 of Remember Window Positions for KDE Plasma 6+. This version fixes a major bug introduced in version 5.0.0. It is recommended to update especially if you use Firefox Extensions. # Existing users need to manually update ([bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=514690) in KDE Discover since 7th of January - see update instructions below) **Here is what has changed since the last update post:** * Fixed a major bug when some windows became transient after being created (instead of during creation) preventing application data to save properly on close and thus preventing restoration. * Example: Firefox extension windows sometimes become transient after creation thus not restoring Firefox on next start. * Added setting to only write save file to disk on shutdown, while less reliable, this might prevent lag issues for HDD users. Use this if you use a HDD as your /home drive and experience lag/stutter when closing apps. * Added firefox to default whitelist and perfect restore list (different package name on arch based distributions). * Added support for restoring tile / quick tile. * The system tile (tiled with shift) and quick tile (edge and Meta + arrow tiling) can now be restored. It is also possible to restore quick tiles that have been resized while the window was closed. (Not enabled by default since it would override saved window size and position). **To update (if the update does not show in Discover):** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Delete the script (your settings won't be deleted), follow steps below to install it again then reboot to apply the update - otherwise old version will be used until next reboot. **To install the script you can:** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Click the `Get New...` in upper right corner. 3. Search for `Remember Window Positions` and click `Install` 4. Enable `Remember Window Positions` in previous menu 5. Click `Apply` to enable it 6. Click the configure icon to change the settings to your liking Or download it from: [https://github.com/rxappdev/RememberWindowPositions](https://github.com/rxappdev/RememberWindowPositions) and install manually.

Separate for user and system installs. Supports bash and python note that I only tested everything on arch systems. Other distros I haven't tested yet. That and I do need to update the json in some readme sections... While this can be used for applications, it's definitely more flexible * Install your dotfiles from a github repo * install docker compose files from a repo * setup and install premade distrobox containers from a repo * ~~or install my nix flake app POCs I did late last year~~ with the right setup, (or package files...) you could even have it grab packages for other package managers.

    "selftext": "# Existing users might need to manually update (bug in KDE Discover since about a week back - see update instructions below) I'm happy to announce that Mouse Tiler v2.0.0 for KDE Plasma 6+ has just been released. For [a short gif animation showing what the tiler does click here](https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler/raw/main/assets/info_animation_v4.gif). **New in this update:** * Added setting to configure the all layouts column count. * Reworked Popup Grid - All Layouts to include a lot of new layouts (can be used to copy to the default layout). Also includes the below special layouts. * Added several special layouts: * SPECIAL\\_MAXIMIZE - same as clicking \"⌞⌝ Maximize\" in the titlebar - useful when using windows without titlebar * SPECIAL\\_MINIMIZE - same as clicking \"🗕 Minimize\" in the titlebar - useful when using windows without titlebar * SPECIAL\\_FULLSCREEN - sets window to \"🗖 Fullscreen\", use Alt+F3 to exit (if there is no other way to exit fullscreen) * SPECIAL\\_KEEP\\_ABOVE - toggles the \"▲ Keep Above\" others * SPECIAL\\_KEEP\\_BELOW - toggles the \"▼ Keep Below\" others * SPECIAL\\_NO\\_TITLEBAR\\_AND\\_FRAME - toggles the \"⊘ No Titlebar and Frame\" * SPECIAL\\_CLOSE - same as clicking \"🗙 Close\" in the titlebar - useful when using windows without titlebar * SPECIAL\\_EMPTY - can be used when using tiles that span multiple layouts (will be improved in future) **Added since last announcement:** * Added possibility to use absolute pixel values in the Popup Tiler configuration. * Add support for Stylus/Touchpad (by using Window top-center as pointer). * Added setting to change default input type (Mouse or Window). * It is now possible to toggle between mouse pointer and window pointer with Ctrl+Alt+I. When window pointer is used, top-center of the window has a small indicator and it is used by the mouse tiles as the current position. **To update (if the update does not show in Discover):** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Delete the script (your settings won't be deleted), follow steps below to install it again then reboot to apply the update. **To install the script you can:** 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Click the `Get New...` in upper right corner. 3. Search for `Mouse Tiler` (you might have to press Enter twice to find it due some issue with KDE store) and click `Install.` 4. Enable `Mouse Tiler` in previous menu. 5. Click `Apply` to enable it. 6. Click the configure icon to change the settings to your liking. You can also download it from the KDE Store: [https://store.kde.org/p/2334027](https://store.kde.org/p/2334027) The github page can be found here: [https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler](https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler) Enjoy and thank you.",

    "selftext": "CtrlAssist v0.4.0 introduces demultiplexing functionality along with enhancements to the system tray and rumble targeting. The updated README now features FAQ and Cookbook sections with practical examples, such as the \"Double Agent Tag Team\" scenario, where a single assist controller uses a demux to help multiple primary players across separate mux instances, and the \"Couch Co-Op Swap\" scenario, in which two players take turns assisting each other using toggle mode, with force feedback following the currently active controller by default. While controller demultiplexing was a requested feature from a prior release, I didn't have a concrete use case until I found myself helping a pair of youngsters play couch co-op multiplayer games with each other. Instead of needing separate assist controllers for each player, otherwise charging/pairing four controllers in total, being able to unicast between mux instances with a single assist controller made juggling both inputs much simpler. Then after being roped into the \"It Takes Two\" session myself, I found being able to swap primary and assist players outright much simpler when both helping and playing, allowing the Helpee to also aid the Helper when it really does take two. ## New Features ### Demux Operation Mode CtrlAssist now supports demultiplexing (demux), allowing a single physical controller to be split into multiple virtual gamepads. This complements the existing multiplexing (mux) functionality and enables more advanced input routing scenarios. **Demux Modes:** - **Unicast** (default): Routes primary controller input to the currently active virtual gamepad. Cycle between virtual gamepads using the reserved Mode button. - Assist multiple players across separate mux instances - **Multicast**: Broadcasts primary controller input to all virtual gamepads simultaneously. - Replicate controller input for advanced input multiplexing pipelines ### Active Rumble Targeting A new \"Active\" rumble target has been added as the default option for mux operations. This routes force feedback to whichever controllers are currently active according to the selected mode: - **Toggle Mode**: Rumble follows the currently active controller - **Priority/Average Modes**: Rumble sent to both controllers, same as before ### Expanded Documentation The README has been significantly expanded with: - **FAQ Section**: Addresses common questions about who CtrlAssist is for, why it was developed, game compatibility, supported controllers, and running multiple instances - **Cookbook Section**: Provides practical examples demonstrating complex multi-instance setups: - Couch Co-Op Swap: Two players alternating assistance - Double Agent Tag Team: One assist controller helping multiple primary players ## Breaking Changes - The rumble target enum options now defaults to \"Active\" instead of \"Both\" - Configuration file format has been extended to accommodate separate mux and demux settings ## Installation CtrlAssist v0.4.0 can be installed via: - **Cargo**: `cargo install ctrlassist --force` - **Flatpak**: Download the bundle from the releases page and install with `flatpak install`",

Right now the bash generation is a bit broken (its better to say that its not really intelligent.. for now), but the node system is working great (i think). SO im asking now what would you think about it (from the sreenshot), is it good looking ? Would you use it (i think not)? And what would you expect if you were using a tool like this? Thanks to everyone that will answer without make fun at it. Im leaving the repo link for anyone who want to test (remember this is really WIP)",

    "selftext": "Once upon a time, we users had [freshmeat.net](http://freshmeat.net), a website where we could discover all kinds of software to use in our Linux systems. Freshmeat's run came to an end. Some time after that, [freshcode.club](http://freshcode.club) was launched with a similar purpose, although it never reached the popularity of freshmeat. However about 3 months ago, freshcode stopped working and now the website is non-functional. So, this leaves us with a question: what is the best way to both discover new software and learn about new releases of existing software, for FOSS projects? I know there's [linux-apps.com](http://linux-apps.com), which is part of the [opendesktop.org](http://opendesktop.org) umbrella. This could have been the answer, but it is dominated by Android slop apps, and no meaningful FOSS software, with some exceptions which are old stalwarts back from the site was known as kde-apps.org. So it's not useful for this purpose, at least at this time. So, again, what would be a good resource to learn about new software and new releases? **EDIT Jan 20, 2026:** Today I checked and [freshcode.club](http://freshcode.club) is working again.

Originally it focused on Unicode-based rendering, but it has since grown into a **full remote desktop system**. Waytermirror can now run in a terminal, on a Linux TTY via framebuffer/KMS, or in a classic GUI mode - whichever fits your setup best. # What it does * **Real-time Wayland capture** Unicode or pixel rendering with multiple capture backends (wlr-screencopy, PipeWire for KDE/GNOME) * **Multiple rendering backends** Braille (2×4 dots), half-blocks, ASCII, hybrid (adaptive), sixel, kitty graphics, framebuffer, KMS, and GUI * **Runs in any terminal** Fully SSH-friendly and usable even over slow or high-latency connections * **Efficient streaming** TCP transport with LZ4 / LZ4-HC compression for Unicode video, HEVC for pixel video, and Opus for audio * **Full input forwarding** Keyboard and mouse support via Wayland protocols or uinput * **Bidirectional audio (WIP)** System audio streaming (server -> client) and microphone forwarding (client -> server) using PipeWire * **Hardware acceleration (optional)** CUDA-accelerated Unicode rendering or hardware-accelerated HEVC encoding on the server * **Multi-monitor support** Including focus-following output selection * **Live controls** Zoom, rotation, quality/detail tuning, and color modes (16 / 256 / truecolor) * **Keyboard-driven workflow** Everything is controlled via shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+Shift prefix): switch renderers, zoom, rotate, mute audio, pause video, and more Open a terminal, connect to the server, and your desktop simply appears. You can switch renderers, tweak quality, or zoom and rotate the view - all live, without restarting the session. **Repository:** [https://github.com/cyber-wojtek/waytermirror](https://github.com/cyber-wojtek/waytermirror) https://preview.redd.it/gve6k8eszjcg1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1cc3d2e03370f4a250ce398689bbbd6b28ededd",

And only after spending a full day I couldn't even figure out how do get a menu to come up on OBS to let me pick a different window to record. Is that even possible with xdg-desktop-portal-wlr? Although I am really adoring how lightweight the \"from the ground up\" configuration can be. I mean I was unbelievably shocked to find out that i havent charged my laptop in 8 hours of use and still see it be at 30 percent. Its an improvement almost three fold. But gosh if only it were simpler. I dont know what I need to have things just work, and I question why things that used to work just dont work anymore. All these programs just hide from you and its an endless cat and mouse chase with my search engine that still barely points me in the right direction. Its super hard to find resources that cover these aspects of linux, and it sucks because this is also the best part about linux. To be able to optimize to your heart and souls content. I envy people who are able to figure this out and create amazing setups, but it also feels incredibly dirty to use someone elses configuration. Its why I havent even brought myself to daily drive quickshell configures, even though they are probably the closest thing you can get to a desktop environment. In more ways than one. (they eat resources like candy). Theres a joy in using something you created yourself. I love mangowc but im not sure if i can get the experience that i truly want from it if cracks start to show right from the get go. I was wondering if there are other fast and light window managers that at least have more support for noobs like me. Would hyprland work out long term if i strip it clean? I dont really care about animations as long as things are snappy. What about niri? Ive heard good things about it too and it even uses gnomes desktop portal, which should have more compatibility right? Should i just use arch because voids init system is unfamiliar and usually undocumented when it comes to usage in software? There are way too many options, and paths, which both have issues in their own ways. Waybar or eww? Dunst or mako? Fuzzel or wofi? systemd or runit? What am i missing? I dont even know! I have lost the point. I just wished it could have been easier to make something i can call my own. I made it a habit to install gnome with every linux installation because I was scared of what time i would lose just trying to put the pieces together all by myself. I took for granted how many things a desktop environment just does for your system that you can pack up and take with you anywhere. Anyway, i have now lost that time and i now know how inconvenient it can be when you just want to get your stuff done and everything is half baked.",

    "selftext": "I just had a realization while dialing in my daily driver. I have a Lenovo laptop. It’s a beast. I love it. It shipped with Windows and it was clunky out of the box. Random freezes. Fingerprint reader would just quit working for a time. The one that haunted me was the keyboard. It would just drop off. Sometimes twice in a few hours, sometimes it wouldn’t happen again for a week or a month. I chased that shit for six months. Logs. Google-fu. Microsoft forums. Support tickets. The whole time it was just “try this… maybe?” vibes. No answers. The problem never actually went away. So I before I got too deeply committed, I put Linux Mint on it. And yeah, it locked up twice while I was doing normal stuff. But here’s the differenence. THERE WAS A LOG. I looked at it and Xorg had absolutely biffed it. Turns out some ancient Xorg 2D rendering thing called *glamor* was hard-locking the graphics and tying up the kernel resulting in it doing absolutely noting. Hard freeze. I googled glamor. Learned it’s optional. Turned it off. Problem gone. And that’s when it clicked. When Linux breaks, it usually tells you *exactly* what broke. It doesn’t just shrug and tell you to reinstall or wait for an update fairy. Sure, the very next day Ubuntu Server decided to “help” by installing its own postfix on a box running Mailcow, tied up port 25, and crashed my mail stack… but at least I knew *why* that happened too. This is why I love running my own junk. It’s not that nothing breaks. It’s that when it does, the system leaves clues that I myself can Sherlock out.",

Its written in python Main function is to launch python scripts like apps, but I added support for flatpacks, steam games and system native apps. Every color can be changed via edit mode or right click, you can replace background with wallpaper. Tiles are moveable, you can create groups and folders. I belive it has like 80% of functionality of original w8 start menu. Missing is search mode and ability for making bigger tiles It sits in tray until \"super+p\" is pressed. It made it for myself and its depended on gnome terminal but if someone is interested i can relase code on git when i get back from work. Old version on pastebin: [download](https://pastebin.com/BYHQWpPa) New version on github: [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/N3Rumii/Lumex8/tree/main) only libraries used are; `PyQt6==6.10.1` `pynput==1.8.1` Edit: I had a lot of troubles with github 2FA and gitlab is confusing so i am just putting code in pastebin. Do i plan on developing it further? Yes, i am surprised by response. While app is enough for me as it is. I seen some good suggestions and i would love to make it more fitting for tablets or devices without \"super+p\" buttons",

    "selftext": "I have been using Linux since last 4 years, started with linux mint and now on fedora KDE workstation. I have friends using windows and Mac. I have used mac for about a month on a borrowed macbook air. Although I just don't like most of the design language of macOS and their laptops are lacking, their are some other things that are just good on it. The only thing that I don't like about Linux is the battery drain while being on browsers, electron apps and while playing videos. Even windows is way better is this aspect. I have not tried linux on intel, so not so sure how is the situation on it. Other than this, I have no issues with anything on linux. MacOS seems so childish to me, designed to be used with mouse more than with keyboard. Too much animations and too much round things. They just spoil the user experience for me. One thing that I miss out on linux is the connectivity with Android, something like macbook and iphone ecosystem. I do know that there is KDE connect, but it comes with its own problems. At this point Linux does almost everything that I want without any issues, except power efficiency, ecosystem integration and some other very minor things . Do you guys think these problems can be solved for linux or just the trade-offs that wouldn't be fixed and need to accepted?",

    "selftext": "EDIT: **This is not asking for support or help!** Just want to clarify. So about two months back I bought the Acer Swift 14 AI with a ryzen AI 365 / 32 gigs of ram / 1TB drive for about 650ish. Was a pretty good deal, installed arch and besides the wrestling match to get the speakers to play audio I was having a great experience. It wasn't until I started putting it into my bag and putting the device to sleep that I would notice. I would leave my morning uni class and go get coffee with a friend and then when I pull my laptop out to take some notes down before the next class, it wouldn't wake up. Kind of thing where you mash the caps key or press the space bar a few times, but after 1-2 minutes I gave up and had to hard power off, and turn on the machine again to get it to get back into linux. This issue was so bad that I considered going back to windows all together because after two months I was tired of it, but then read an interesting forum post from another user seeing that the iommu would have issues waking up. I use systemd boot, so I went to the conf file in /boot/loader/entries/ to edit my arch.conf. under the options line, I added `amd_iommu=off` at the end, saved it, rebooted. I have never had an issue since I added it. For grub you would have to edit the grub config file in /etc/default/grub at the line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=` add `amd_iommu=off`, save it and then update the grub. Hope this fixes the issue for someone else, because even after asking other people and suggesting it was kernel panic I wasn't able to find a fix.",

    "selftext": "If you use NetworkManager and automatic/\"persistent\" Ethernet device naming (the default in Fedora and probably other distributions), you'll note that your USB Ethernet adapter will have a different name depending on which USB port you plug it into. Take advantage of this by configuring it to be a static IP on one port, and DHCP on another - NetworkManager will remember these configurations as being associated with the device name and thus the particular USB port, even if it's the same actual adapter both times. Then you can switch between configs really easily on the road. **Example use case:** I sometimes work in a datacentre that needs a special static IP and VLAN configuration, but most of the time I'm on a \"normal\" Ethernet port at the office - if I plug my USB Ethernet into the left side of my laptop, I get the special datacentre static config; if I plug it into the right side, bog standard DHCP. I don't even have to click anything or activate any network profiles, and nothing needs to auto-detect my location, either - it just works.",

    "title": "I made a security tool kprotect that blocks \"bad\" scripts from touching your private files (using eBPF)",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! So, for the past few months, I’ve been obsessed with how easy it is for a random npm install or pip install to just... steal all your SSH keys or .env files. We always talk about supply-chain attacks, but I wanted something that actually stops them without me having to manually check every line of code in every library I use. I called it kprotect, and I finally got it to a point where it's actually usable (at least on my machine lol). What the heck is it? Basically, it sits in the Linux kernel (using eBPF LSM) and watches which processes are trying to touch your sensitive files. But instead of just looking at what process it is, it looks at the whole lineage. The \"Chain of Trust\" thing: This is the part I'm most proud of. You can tell kprotect: \"Hey, I only trust cat to read my SSH keys IF it was started by VS Code -> Terminal.\" If some random python [unsafe.py](http://unsafe.py) tries to call cat to read those same keys? Blocked. Even if you're running as root! Because the \"chain\" doesn't match what you authorized. Some cool (I think) features: Near-zero lag: Since it’s eBPF, it's super fast. Encrypted stuff: All the logs and configs are AES-encrypted so a hacker can't just edit them to white-list themselves. A GUI! I spent way too much time on a Tauri/React dashboard so you don't have to live in the terminal if you don't want to. Live feed: You can watch processes pop up and get blocked in real-time. It’s actually kind of satisfying to watch. Disclaimer: I'm just one person working on this in my free time, so it's definitely in \"beta\" (0.1.0-beta). It needs a recent-ish kernel (5.10+) with BPF LSM enabled. If you're on Ubuntu/Debian/Arch, it should work fine after a quick tweak. I’d love for some of you to try it out and tell me if it’s actually useful or if I’m just crazy. Bug report or donation is very welcome ! **Link:** [https://github.com/khoinp1012/kprotect](https://github.com/khoinp1012/kprotect)",

    "selftext": "I have recently been trying to setup an \"ecosystem\" , not hoping to parallel IOS integrations but as a primary system integration cross devices , mostly my Laptop (running Debian with Gnome) and my phone (running android) , which has been not only a hassle but also very time consuming as connection applications such as KDEconnect (GSconnect for Gnome) often glitches out and lacks some of the core functionality like copy and pasting across devices. I have been using SCRCPY (Screen Copy) for the last few days to have a live display of my phone on my laptop to view notifications and such. Being fair , I do not expect IOS levels of integration as that is a wet dream for many but is hardly a reality in an open source project such as linux. File sharing has also been a hassle with KDEconnect since sometimes it just randomly bugs out and just refuses to share a file even when I'm on the same network , and as for the copy and paste options , it is not so much as a tedious task but simply annoying to have to press a button every time i need to send something over , even though agreeably it is due to privacy concerns. Using Syncthing was a bit better since it is a one time setup and forget service but it does not come with its disadvantages of having to spend a lot of time configuring it to your desired need's. Is the Linux ecosystem dream a waste or is there a day when we will have seamless integration? Any applications or services suggested for such integration purposes?",

    "selftext": "After I switched to linux recently, I started to like to get my things done in terminal so wanted a simple way to keep notes without switching to a GUI app. So I built a terminal-based sticky notes TUI focused on keyboard-first workflows and a clean interface. **Key Features:** * **Keyboard-Centric:** Navigate, add, edit, and delete notes without touching the mouse. * **Color Coding:** 9 different color themes to organize thoughts visually (Hotkeys 1-9). * **Priorities & Pinning:** Set priorities (Trivial to Critical) and pin important notes to the top. * **Search Modal:** Filter notes instantly by title, content, or tags. * **Auto-Save:** Data is persistent and saved to your OS's standard data directory (XDG on Linux). * **Modern Tooling:** The project is managed with `uv` for fast and reliable dependency management. **Installation:** I included a helper script for Linux users to install it globally to `/usr/local/bin`: Bash git clone https://github.com/dengo07/textual-sticky-notes-tui cd sticky-notes-tui sudo ./manage.sh install Now you can just type `stickynotes` from anywhere. I’d appreciate feedback from Linux and terminal users, especially around usability and whether this fits a real daily workflow.",

    "selftext": ">The main one, at least in fedora, is tuned: [https://tuned-project.org/](https://tuned-project.org/) It uses existing tools like powertop, and other specific interfaces like ethtools. By far the most comprehensive one. \\- >A famous one is tlp: [https://linrunner.de/tlp/introduction.html](https://linrunner.de/tlp/introduction.html) It is a oneshot run program triggered by NetworkManager and udev hooks, meant for laptops with rather hacky techniques being there no daemon \\- >System76-power: [https://github.com/pop-os/system76-power](https://github.com/pop-os/system76-power) Manages multi-GPU setups where you can launch diff. programs on diff. GPUs, but also handles power profiles for their COSMIC DE. Does a little more tasks which are done by compositor's children in other DEs. Can run alongside tuned as far as I am aware. \\- >power-profiles-daemon: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/power-profiles-daemon](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/power-profiles-daemon) The most useless stub, the most common too among DEs. Just hardcoded profiles doing the most basic of throttling, the bare minimum of sysfs knobs touched for it's general-purpose outlook. Someone also glued it to the otherwise conflicting TLP to make it useful: [https://github.com/Rongronggg9/power-profiles-daemon](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/power-profiles-daemon) \\- \\- However some good daemons exist which do specific tasks, though I've only found intel-specific so far These are meant to be used alongside any one of the implementations above, they perform very specific tasks good. IDK what for AMD though. \\- >thermald: [https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/thermald/thermald.8.en](https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/thermald/thermald.8.en) Takes over some logic of thermal temp. handling and friends, can act as exclusive thermal controller over kernel sysfs if specified on the CLI. Greatly improves some systems' thermal capacities. \\- >LPMD: [https://github.com/intel/intel-lpmd](https://github.com/intel/intel-lpmd) Selects the most power-efficient CPUs based on CPU topology. Depending on system utilization does work by activating the power-efficient CPUs and disabling the rest, and vice versa. Meant to significantly cap idle wastage. \\- So... Kindly discuss. PS I am aware that alternatives are a nature of Linux, but this seems confusing, esp. when you factor in that in function and knobs they seem more like duplicates than alternatives.",

    "title": "[Guide] Affinity v3 on Linux with working curves (and classic colored icons) (WineFix + AffinityOnLinux)",
    "selftext": "I finally have Affinity v3 running really nicely on Linux with correctly drawn vector previews, handles/paths and classic colored icons (which I prefer). None of this is my own code; I just combined existing tools and wanted to share a setup that actually works. My setup: * Fedora KDE * Wayland * AMD / RADV I mainly use vector tools, but so far this has been solid. The key pieces are: * AffinityOnLinux (for install + Wine prefix) * [https://github.com/ryzendew/Linux-Affinity-Installer](https://github.com/ryzendew/Linux-Affinity-Installer) * AffinityPluginLoader + WineFix v0.2.0 (for fixing the curve previews) * [https://github.com/noahc3/AffinityPluginLoader](https://github.com/noahc3/AffinityPluginLoader) Below is what worked for me, step by step. 1. Install basic tools Example for Fedora (adjust for your distro): Run: `sudo dnf install python3-pyqt6 p7zip p7zip-plugins cabextract` 2. Run AffinityOnLinux installer and install Affinity v3 Project: [https://github.com/ryzendew/Linux-Affinity-Installer](https://github.com/ryzendew/Linux-Affinity-Installer) In a terminal, run: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryzendew/AffinityOnLinux/refs/heads/main/AffinityScripts/AffinityLinuxInstaller.py | python3` In the GUI: 1. Click \"One‑Click Full Setup\" and let it finish. 2. When prompted what to install, I chose \"Affinity (Unified)\" (v3). 3. I have also successfully installed Affinity Designer and Photo v2 through this tool. I left these options: * Renderer: `vkd3d‑proton` * OpenCL: unchecked (disabled) – this seemed more stable for me. By default this created a Wine prefix at: `$HOME/.AffinityLinux` and installed Affinity to: `$HOME/.AffinityLinux/drive_c/Program Files/Affinity/Affinity/Affinity.exe` (If your prefix or paths differ, adjust accordingly in the commands below.) 3. Fix the broken vector previews (WineFix) This is what fixed the “blue paths don’t match the curve” / misaligned handles problem. Project: [https://github.com/noahc3/AffinityPluginLoader](https://github.com/noahc3/AffinityPluginLoader) 1. Go to the releases page: 2. [https://github.com/noahc3/AffinityPluginLoader/releases](https://github.com/noahc3/AffinityPluginLoader/releases) 3. From `v0.2.0 – \"The curves, they work!\"`, download the file 4. `affinitypluginloader-plus-winefix.tar.xz` 5. Extract it into your Affinity install directory: * Create a working folder: * `cd ~` * `mkdir -p affinity-pluginloader` * `cd affinity-pluginloader` * Move the tar.xz there if it’s in Downloads, for example: * `mv ~/Downloads/affinitypluginloader-plus-winefix.tar.xz .` * Extract into the Affinity install dir: * `tar -xvf affinitypluginloader-plus-winefix.tar.xz -C \"$HOME/.AffinityLinux/drive_c/Program Files/Affinity/Affinity\"` 6. Wrap the real Affinity executable with the loader: * Go to the install dir: * `cd \"$HOME/.AffinityLinux/drive_c/Program Files/Affinity/Affinity\"` * Rename the original exe so you can revert if needed: * `mv \"Affinity.exe\" \"Affinity.real.exe\"` * Rename the hook exe so it becomes the new launcher: * `mv \"AffinityHook.exe\" \"Affinity.exe\"` * (If the hook exe has a slightly different name in your release, use that instead of `AffinityHook.exe`.) From now on when you run `Affinity.exe`, it goes through the loader + WineFix and patches the Direct2D curves. This is what made my vector previews finally match the actual paths. 4. Optional: fix the launcher if it does not start In my case, the generated desktop launcher was wrong. I edited the `.desktop` file so the `Exec` line looked like this: `Exec=env WINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/.AffinityLinux\" wine \"$HOME/.AffinityLinux/drive_c/Program Files/Affinity/Affinity/Affinity.exe\"` If your launcher already works, you don’t need to change anything here. 5. Reversibility If something breaks or you just want to undo the loader: 1. Go to the install dir: 2. `cd \"$HOME/.AffinityLinux/drive_c/Program Files/Affinity/Affinity\"` 3. Swap the names back: 4. `mv \"Affinity.exe\" \"AffinityHook.exe\"` (or whatever the hook was called) 5. `mv \"Affinity.real.exe\" \"Affinity.exe\"` That puts you back to the original Affinity install. You can also delete extra files from the plugin loader if you want, but renaming back is enough to restore behavior. 6. Enable the classic colored icons The old colored icons suite me better than the new monochrome ones. What I did: 1. Install the Windows 10 SDK/runtime (on Fedora): 2. `sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-10.0` 3. Re‑open the AffinityOnLinux installer: 4. `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryzendew/AffinityOnLinux/refs/heads/main/AffinityScripts/AffinityLinuxInstaller.py | python3` 5. In the GUI, click the button to enable/install the colored icons. With this combo: * AffinityOnLinux + Affinity v3 (Unified) * WineFix v0.2.0 * Classic colored icons Big thanks to all you wine devs who made this possible!",

    "title": "What do y'all think about Government Grants for FOSS?",
    "selftext": "In light of the uptick in end-of-year posts reminding individual Linux fans to donate (or \"tip\") their favorite FOSS applications they use on the daily, I've been thinking about the current crisis in FOSS funding; about how many FOSS devs are burned out due to being solo or almost-solo maintainers; about how, except in the biggest names in the industry, most devs cannot sustain themselves and work on FOSS fulltime. I've also been thinking about how urging individual charity can distract from systemic underfunding, which can only be addressed with systemic solutions. So, I wanted to gauge the community's thoughts on **Government Grants**. That is, a nation-state gives money to FOSS developers to work on their software. I'll outline some of the advantages I think it has, the precedents for this sort of thing, and concerns I (expect) people might have. ## How does the Government decide who to fund?? It's called a grant proposal; welcome to what universities have been doing for decades. Get in line. ## Has it been done before?? Yes, in the rest of STEM. Most major scientific research is backed by federal funding, NOT private companies. Medical research especially. The development of the modern smartphone and even the Machine Learning behind the current AI financial bubble relies critically on government-funded research to even be possible in the first place. Companies don't fund public knowledge that takes decades to pan out, if at all; yet that sort of exploration is exactly what allows Science to advance. ## Who will pay for it?? **TAXES** There is definitely a wider discussion to be had about how tax policy can be conducted, but literally all grants are taxpayer-funded. ## But Donald Trump...! I agree, the current political climate in the US is not amenable to \"public good\" projects. But things can and will get better, and pushing for funding for this sort of thing at the federal level can help make that happen. Plus, if the EU wants that \"digital sovereignty\" they are after, directly funding the development of the software that can lead to it would help them. ## But then the country controls the software! And would Big Tech™ be any better? Anyway. What do you think? Should we urge our governments to fund FOSS?",

    "title": "GUI for Keyboard RGB on Linux (XMG/Clevo/wootbook/TongFang) – No Electron, No Bloat.",
    "selftext": "Hi. First time poster here, don't post much on reddit in general. but I thought I'd share this if someone was interested in using it. **The Problem:** Bought a wootbook y15 pro laptop from wootware in south africa in december but found out when i installed Nobara that the keyboard lighting and power management from the windows control center wasn't on linux. Closest functional equivalent I could find is Tuxedo Control center, also tried openRGB but both didnt detect my keyboard. **The Solution:** I spent the last few weeks playing around with the USB protocols and realized that 95% of these laptops use the same ITE 8291 controller, just with different IDs. Started writing a small app to control the lighting once i found my device ID and got control of the lighting. then built a UI around this workflow. it currently has a 2-tier best-effort approach using either kernel drivers as a first choice or the custom/modified ITE driver as a fallback (my case). Current use is: \\- [install.sh](http://install.sh) \\- choose configs via commandline \\- open tray and per-key menu and set key positions and background (a template of my machine is pre-loaded so most of the placement should already be setup, just keyboard-specific movements, supports resize dragging, moving and fine-tuning via text fields. Has an attempt at auto-aligning the rows to get some better alignment (My best attempt) \\- after the keyboard grid is setup run the calibrator to match the raw LED ID to the actual key on the keyboard \\- Done. Control via tray icon Supports per-key profiling + software effects (currently testing reactive typing) at the same time or alternatively you can just use the pre-configured hardware effects on the controller. Has some shortcuts on the tray menu with optional power management features to sync keyboard lighting to screen brightness and dim via settings toggle. Made an attempt to make it easier to install via a batch install and uninstall script. though with linux being linux your mileage may vary on its success. There's also an option to clone the repo and manually add your device ID's or additional backends if the automated process doesn't support your device, I only added safe, confirmed tongfang chassis ID's based on my identified one, whats present in the windows software that came with the machine and what is confirmed online. Been daily driving it for the last week on the current version (0.11.1) and ram usage is stable at 44 mb on my machine (Nobara 43) and power management features are mostly working pretty well. Repo link: [https://github.com/Rainexn0b/keyRGB](https://github.com/Rainexn0b/keyRGB) Disclaimer: I tried my best to make it as safe as possible but this is my first public github project. if you are interested in trying it and have an issue. please open an issue via the 2 templates. If you have any feedback for me id love to hear it. I mainly made this project for myself but thought id also share it if it could potentially help other people. There are still some placeholder assets. Project is currently still considered a beta so there may be bugs. Permissions: Inherently requires udev rules for core functionality + optional features, these can be inspected if you wish. TLDR: I made an app to control keyboard lighting for most tongfang-chassis laptops XMG/Clevo/wootbook etc on linux, tested heavily on Nobara/Fedora. showcase/screenshots in repo. Use at own discretion.",

    "title": "Learning linux with Dad 101",
    "selftext": "So i told my kids that they should learn Linux, its the only operating system (yes i know its a kernel but thats not important yet) that is Dad approved. I got laptops for all my kids and installed Ubuntu on their laptops. Well only my youngest daughter has shown any interest in knowing how to do more than wiggle the mouse around the screen lol. I told the kiddos this class is voluntary and starts no later than 9am on Sunday mornings, class goes until 10:30 am. We keep it simple 1 concept and 1 goal every sunday. Sunday mornings my youngest daughter (9) comes out of her room bright eyed and ready for \"Learning Linux with Dad 101\" at 5am. Im awake and it fits the requirements \"before 9am of your own accord.\" Before today in previous classes we learned what a computer is, what a computer isnt, how to turn it on, navigate around to different places and find what we are looking for. Real basic operations and concepts which leads us to this morning. Today we opened the \"scary terrminal.\" Its weird, its not like anything we have seen yet, much different than the gui navigation. Today's lesson concept was simple: The computer is a place, think of it like a house. A house has rooms, these rooms have things in them. In the terminal we call this house the \"home directory\" (for now) and inside are rooms we call directories, inside these directories are things we call files. The terminal is a map, it shows us the rooms inside the house, it also shows us the things inside the rooms. Learn how file explorer and terminal are the same thing, they are maps that show us where we are and whats around us. Today's commands to learn: pwd, ls, cd, cd .., mkdir, and cat. What is a command? A command tells the map where to look and what to look for. So Today's task was to open terminal and file explorer, use pwd to show us where we are in the house, use ls to show us whats inside the rooms, use cat to look at the things. After some practice the task was use file explorer to create a directory (or a folder, or a new room in our house) anywhere and create a text document using text editor and type our favorite number, our favorite animal, and our favorite color. Save the file into our new directory and close all the windows. Now open the terminal and use the commands to find where your file is, then use the cat command to show us what is in the file. Then do it with the gui, note how they are showing us the same things in different ways. The goal, see how using terminal and the desktop gui are the same even if they feel and look different. See the similarities and the differences, know how to navigate with both. Then for some extra credit I made a text document in a different directory and saved it and closed all the windows. I asked her to find the file I made and told her to do it without asking me for help and to use the command cheat sheet I gave her if she couldnt remember the commands using the terminal, or she could do it with the file explorer, it was her choice. I intentionally didnt tell her how to navigate between different directories in file explorer. The payoff of the \"proud dad\" moment when she said \"hey dad, look!\" And there on her screen was a terminal window and in the output was the text from the document I created listed after the cat command she entered to see it!!! The moral of the story, teach your kids linux, teach them how to use the cli and give them a super power they will forever have before they even understand its a super power 💪. This girl is going to be a wizard before she gets to highschool.",

    "selftext": "I've been using the official Spotify Flatpak on Linux for a while, but the ads kept getting more annoying. I tried finding an alternative for BlockTheSpot for Linux. but nothing promising came up. I do know that you can just use a spotify web with firefox and ublock origin, but it just wasn't doing it for me., so I built a small patcher that works directly on the Flatpak install instead, with a single command. It modifies the app's bundle to: * Skip audio and video ads entirely * Remove banner placements * Hide the \"Explore Premium\" button in the top bar Everything is done with string/regex patches on the JS and CSS files inside the [xpui.spa](http://xpui.spa) archive. It makes a backup first (xpui.spa.bak), so you can always roll back. There's also a dry-run mode to preview changes and a status check to see what's applied. Or run the uninstall script to clean everything up. The patches are based on current Spotify versions, but client updates can break them—when that happens, it's usually just a matter of updating the signatures in the code. I've kept it simple so anyone can tweak or contribute. Repo: [https://github.com/Nikish-codes/spotless](https://github.com/Nikish-codes/spotless?referrer=grok.com) If you're running the Flatpak version and try it out, let me know how it goes.",

    "title": "Why don't distros just wrap language-specific package managers instead of repackaging everything?",
    "selftext": "Hi, I realize this is a very random and controversial topic, but bear with me. So far, I've written a total of two Linux tools myself. However, I realized that I don't make any of them installable for different distros separately, in other words deploy them for other distros. If I do, I only deploy them on AUR and that's all I bother with. Maybe I'm just a bit lazy, but there's a commonly mentioned point that deploying a program for Linux is quite cumbersome. Because for each distribution, you have to deploy, that is, create packages, then track the versions of the relevant libraries, and act accordingly. However, while writing these two rather insignificant tools, I realized something: Deploying these programs in the repository of the language (pip, cargo etc.) is quite easy and quite universal. So my suggestion is this: Yes, perhaps there will be libraries and binary files scattered throughout the system. However, if we overlook this and assume that all these packages from different package managers can be managed nicely by the distro's own package manager (**TLDR**): Why do distros bother to keep packages in their repositories that can be installed using the package managers of the languages themselves (like bun, cargo, uv)? Why don't package managers use extra tools like “uv tool install,” or “cargo,” or “bun” internally? Proof of concept: [https://github.com/ripytide/metapac](https://github.com/ripytide/metapac) **Edit:** I realized in the comments that I had expressed myself poorly. Try to see the concept I mentioned as an experimental path. Not as an instant change, but as a gradual transition. **Edit 2:** To give you an idea about the issue, Linus's talk about package managers: [https://youtu.be/Pzl1B7nB9Kc](https://youtu.be/Pzl1B7nB9Kc) (from 5:55)",

    "selftext": "This might actually be a bug in the mount command, but, for any filesystem: mount /dev/sdXy nonexistent_mountpoint Will invoke the filesystem driver to fully prepare the filesystem for mounting, and only fails at the very end when it realises the mountpoint path doesn't exist. This includes journal replay, device scan/addition, etc. So, if you ever have a weird use case where you need to do this to filesystems but want to save yourself the extra \"unmount\" command, there you go. Yes, most filesystems' check tools have a way to do the same thing, but that varies, and this way you don't have to remember anything filesystem-specific. (My weird edge case where this is handy: I need to fsck filesystems that are temporarily attached from VMs that had something bad happen to their underlying storage, and the fsck equivalent for some of them, e.g. `xfs_repair -n` , cares about the journal being cleared by a normal mount first. Don't worry; it doesn't matter that the journal replay is a write operation; I'm working on throwaway clones of these VMs.)",

I personally find Gnome with a couple of extensions to be far more aesthetic, intuitive and polished than stock clunky experience from KDE Plasma. While ricing can make it better, it also makes it more likely to break.

I have found an interest in GNU, Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. While I don't fully agree with all of his justifications that I read in the GNU Manifesto, I find his politics to be mostly agreeable and positive for the working class and environment. The point of this post is regarding the Distro's listed in the GNU website: [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) They all seem to be pretty bare-bones, and even less hardware compatible than something like Debain, for the purpose of removing all non-free and proprietary firmware blobs. I think this goal is very noble and positive in-general, but the sacrifice is obviously not good enough for the majority of computer users in the 21st century. My question is, from a new Linux user to the more tech-savvy and long-time users, how much time or work is needed for these Distro's to be usable as daily drivers for most people? Is there any realistic time frame the community has in mind for this goal to be reached? Obviously the interest in maintaing and developing these Distro's is quit low, otherwise I wouldn't have to be asking this question, but maybe some people in the know can answer my question?

Here is video of Linux desktop running on Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 based Motorola phone: https://youtu.be/hQqcjwKO9d0?si=LipYay5oe7hzhL2w Our latest Linux desktop is now based on Debian Trixie (13.2). You can download a free evaluation version from www.volkspc.org. Also we have created a FAQ page with answers to common questions from the Linux community. Vasant",

    "selftext": "I wrote this utility to perform \\`File Integrity Monitoring\\` of critical files on a linux system. In current state, it captures, create, update & deletion. What stands out is unlike capturing every event, the binary does in-kernel filtering to ignore certain actions such as \\`read\\`, \\`stat\\` by users \\`root\\` or app users who regularly access those files. In addition to this, when users switch to root/app users to access the files, those actions are captured too. The performance penalty compared to other userspace monitoring tools is minimal as ebpf runs in kernel. This is all configurable via a config file like below:: `monitored_files:` `- /tmp/testfile` `- /etc/passwd` `- /etc/shadow` `ignore_actions:` `- read` `- stat` `ignore_users:` `- root` A sample log trial:: `2025/08/18 07:22:09 Monitoring started. Ctrl+C to exit.` `2025/08/18 07:22:37 Event: PID=1745080 UID=6087179 (6087179 (harsha)) CMD=touch FILE=/tmp/testfile FLAGS=00000941 ## actual user` `2025/08/18 07:22:54 Event: PID=1745108 UID=0 (0 (root) [Login: 6087179 (harsha)]) CMD=touch FILE=/tmp/testfile FLAGS=00000941 ## even after sudo` GH repo :: [https://github.com/harshavmb/fim-ebpf](https://github.com/harshavmb/fim-ebpf) I hope you find this tiny utility helpful.",

Sure, you can install Plasma, but first impressions matter. There's lazy, and then there's \"this isn't just working like I was promised because they lack Wayland\" and Mint is the latter for these people (fun fact, Plasma was once an official edition, they nixed it but kept MATE, who even uses that?) But these are niche, right? Well, 3 niches is three times the users disappointed, and frankly, in nerdy tech spaces like this, they aren't exactly niche. It's like the number of games that don't work on linux is like 10%, but there's a GOOD chance the average user has at least ONE game that doesn't work. I guess for these people we recommend K/Ubuntu, Pop or Zorin. Same ease of use, but with wayland support out of the box.",

Some of the projects I donated to are KDE, Syncthing, Ankidroid, and a few others that have been invaluable for me. What FOSS projects would you consider supporting? Are there any FOSS projects that are flying under the radar and could use more support? Even small donations help cover some costs and shows developers that their work matters. Happy new year to you all! Enjoy!",

    "title": "MiDesktop (KDE1 fork) Development Preview Release",
    "selftext": "Some of you may recall my post from a year ago [Software left in nostalgia-land ≠ dead software - bringing KDE1 into the modern world ](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1htnhwq/software_left_in_nostalgialand_dead_software/)\\- where I teased this project. Eventually it made its way to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwuFhaWwmAw), and not too long after that I was invited to the [Tech over Tea podcast to discuss the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgpFJyO1O8). I've been relatively quiet since then, but today I'm extremely excited to share this first development preview release with everyone finally! For those not caught up, MiDesktop (formerly MiDE) is a fork of KDE1, ported to the Osiris toolkit (itself a fork of Qt2), and fixed to run on modern Linux systems. It's blazing fast and lean, aesthetically functional and distraction-less. Today, packages are available for Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04. You can now get a glimpse at what the Linux desktop was like in the late 90s/early 2000s, without all the trouble to get it running. I'd be remiss not to explicitly note that this is a **development preview** release, which means that there **are** bugs and there may also be undiscovered security issues, so be aware that MiDesktop is *not* considered stable yet. For those just itching to get their hands on the packages, head over to [this page](https://libranext.com/midesktop/) to get installation instructions. You can also [get the source here](https://centre.libranext.com/libranext/mide/-/tree/1.2?ref_type=heads) and compile it yourself if you want, though the packages are recommended, as you'll get updates as they are released, and they are *generally* known to work. A Discord server is available if you need help getting it up and running too, though apparently I cannot link that here.. **Errata** There's a bunch of known issues/bugs, but the most glaring ones are listed here: * Firefox and Chrome do not behave/resize correctly. Firefox panics and expands to infinity off the right side of the screen, and Google Chrome simply refuses to be adjusted from its small box at all. This is the biggest thing keeping anyone from daily driving it * Taskbar menus show when clicked but disappear immediately * Expanding categories in the Control Center sometimes doesn't actually expand the list visibly, or behave as expected * There is no multi-monitor awareness, though it will expand across all available screens without complaining. **Plans?** Yes, lots! Unfortunately development has been a bit slower than I expected, but good results take time. I've recently had more time freed up so dev speed will pick up a bit here. * You'll notice that a lot of KDE applications are missing. Currently, just the very basics are working. I plan to get the other applications working and included, so you'll have KEdit, KWrite, KCalc, KMix, etc., though the names are likely to slightly change to not get confused with modern KDE (similar to how Trinity Desktop renamed things) * Fix scrolling in all applications * Add power options (shutdown, restart, etc) to the logout menu * Re-write KDM to work on a modern system * Add sound support back in with support for the modern sound stack * A Wayland port is planned, though that's going to take a lot of time and effort That's all for now. Enjoy, and happy new year! https://preview.redd.it/em1hhrjtirag1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2faf49c178b3fbad952ee28f762ecef5acd781a6",

    "selftext": "I started using linux when I was in middle school. My first install was redhat that I installed with floppy disks (no joke). I quickly moved onto Slackware and FreeBSD (i know, not linux), which I used for years and then Arch. I used it as my primary OS, if something was broken I figured it out. I read slashdot, wrote my own iptables, did my own shell scripting, absolutely loved it. Everything took a ton of work though. I would spend days troubleshooting at times. Then I got decided on a massive career change from IT security to healthcare. I got an iphone and mac and left linux in the past. I got bored and decided to install ubuntu LTS on an XPS i bought just for it. Wiped the drive clean and just went for it. Wow, shit just works now. The drivers for everything work perfectly. All the keyboard keys work. Gaming on steam is even better than windows! The UI is sooo clean. Wayland is a HUGE upgrade from x11. Linux is truly ready for prime time now, though I guess people just don't care as much about using a PC now. Sorry, just had to share. All my linux nerd friends long ago quit and went to OSX and had families same as me. I'm very impressed so far, though I feel kind of like a tool using ubuntu. I'll probably get my feet wet and go back to Arch. Anything anyone else would suggest? What else did I miss over these 15 years? edit: 1/1/26. installed endeavouros. this is what i wanted, i just didnt know it yet. thanks for the suggestions everyone. edit: found wayland bugs. why is copy and paste broken from browsers to terminal??",

    "selftext": "Bash has an impressively bad help command (Completely useless to those who'd actually need it, I don't think I need to elaborate) and zsh doesn't have any. Idk about the others. So I thought of getting the community together to talk about what information should be in it, so that it's a good enough command that it can be universal to standard shells and could realistically be shown to a new user to put them on their way, instead of dumping several dozen commands that may or may not ever be useful to them. To me, a good one would be: * No more than like 30-ish lines of text containing no more than two non-list paragraphs, to avoid overwhelming users * Explains the basic command structure (Command arg filepath) * Listing under 10 or 12 commands that everyone will use * Under 5 keybindings * Enough guidance and dropping enough googleable verbs (One of the most important parts of learning new skills, for me) for users to find their way on more complex tasks (Apropos, man) * Maybe one or two subsections with more advanced, but still often used topics (Piping and redirects is what comes to mind, because if users are still new and in the copypaste command stage they'll see them) that can be brought up with help piping. Additionally, we could have a handful (Less than five) commands to help users find documentation without having to leave the terminal and that are recommended to be included with the base install of any OS including this help. I already mentioned apropos and man, and after having it pointed out a little ago tldr seems like a pretty great tool to find one's bearings too. I drafted a help text [here](https://gist.github.com/DuendeInexistente/3dbd87f3539bbda505ef97ed5092d910), though it's at nearly twice of the length I'd consider ideal to avoid overwhelming people.",

    "selftext": "This is my 4th year with Linux so i wanted to share my experience with Linux all the way from the start. My pc was getting older by the year so windows (in windows fashion) stopped supporting my computer, and i was forced into windows7 and the driver and steam issues were crazy. then i was scrolling on youtube and found a video of someone learning Linux from scratch. I became inspired and downloaded my first distro Manjaro without any knowledge. (Big mistake) After that i was fucked with how hard Manjaro was for me and went back to windows. A few months later i did research before trying Linux again and downloaded Linux Mint and ive been daily using it since. I had some experiences with Arch but none were good so im not gonna go into Arch for now but i wanna try it again this year if i get a better pc. So heres how i learned and prepped for Linux and also my tips if you are getting into it or have someone learning Linux: I only learned Apt and nothing else before trying Linux and that teached me thru experience so i recommend using a Debian based for your first distro Always have a ventoy with another windows iso in it so if you cant get stuff working you can always go back Looks arent important if youre learning when you feel like youre done with the terminal try to download the theme (if its done on it) Always check on reddit or other websites they probably can solve your problem in 1 to 5 comments Dont forget about Flatpak its really useful. Thats all i hope for another year without any system bugs :D",

    "selftext": "Coming from Windows, SSMS was everywhere in my workflow. Even for simple tasks like running a few queries or updating rows, I had to launch this gigabyte-heavy behemoth that took ages to start. When I switched to Linux, SSMS wasn't an option anymore. The popular solution was VS Code's SQL extension. But launching an Electron-based code editor just to execute SQL queries felt... wrong. I'd recently discovered the beauty of Terminal UIs - fast, keyboard-driven, and efficient. I tried existing SQL TUIs like lazysql and harlequin, but they didn't click with me the way tools like lazygit did. Nothing felt as intuitive or had that \"just works\" experience. So I built Sqlit - a lightweight, keyboard-driven SQL TUI inspired by lazygit's workflow. What it does: * Connect to databases and browse tables/views/schemas * Run queries with syntax highlighting and autocomplete * Vim-style keybindings and intuitive navigation * Multiple themes (Tokyo Night, Nord, etc. Syncs up if you use Omarchy) * Supports SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, Oracle, DuckDB, CockroachDB, ClickHouse, Snowflake, and more Sqlit deliberately avoids bloat. It's not trying to be a full-featured database IDE with performance graphs and schema designers. It focuses on doing one thing well: making it fast and enjoyable to connect, browse, and query your databases without the overhead of GUI applications.

To install the script you can: 1. Open `System Settings` \\> `Window Management` \\> `KWin Scripts`. 2. Click the `Get New...` in upper right corner. 3. Search for `Mouse Tiler` (you might have to press Enter twice to find it due some issue with KDE store) and click `Install.` 4. Enable `Mouse Tiler` in previous menu. 5. Click `Apply` to enable it. 6. Click the configure icon to change the settings to your liking. You can also download it from the KDE Store: [https://store.kde.org/p/2334027](https://store.kde.org/p/2334027) The github page can be found here: [https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler](https://github.com/rxappdev/MouseTiler) Enjoy and thank you.",

Because my PC is 10 years old, intel X99 platform and build way before ReBAR was ever a thing. And I needed a cheap-ish GPU that performs similar to the GTX1080 that was in there, but that was preferably not another nvidia card and good Linux driver support. I eventually found ReBarUEFI, which lets you basically reconfigure any UEFI BIOS with ReBAR support which could help in gpu choice. Fast forward a few weeks, and I got me nice Asus RX 6650XT real cheap and happy camper. Can play some games again if I want to. Biggest surprise though? With bios option \\`4G Decoding\\` enabled and kernel parameter \\`pci=realloc\\` there is full ReBAR support on this platform from 2016 that's never supposed to have it, on Linux. Whereas in Microsoft-land, you have to have bios updates, update your platform to a supported level, special drivers yada-yada. Who's fooling who? If you can have it Linux, regardless of what you use, it could be done in Windows as well. Instead, all parties involved appear to pull up artificial barriers and sell more stuff. Meanwhile, here I am on Linux, using a card introduced in 2022 on a platform from 2014 and being able to use that card to its full potential. Or at least not held back by artificial barriers.

Back then, the author was flamed by kernel and glibc devs, seemingly partly because back then x86\\_64 had near complete dominance of computing (the main developer of glibc even referring to arm as \"[embedded crap](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5070#c5)\"). However a lot has changed in 16 years. With the rise in arm use outside of embedded devices and risc-v potentially also seeing more use in the future, perhaps it's time to revive this idea seeing as now we have multiple incompatible architectures floating around seeing widespread use. The original author has [said](https://github.com/icculus/fatelf/issues/1#issuecomment-1783983363) that he does not want to attempt this himself, so perhaps someone else can? Maybe I'm just being stupid here and there's a big reason this isn't a good idea. Some more discussion about reviving this can be found [here](https://github.com/icculus/fatelf/issues/1).

    "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about Valve’s Project Lepton lately, and I’m curious if anyone else sees the same potential here or if I’m overreading it. On the surface, Lepton looks like an Android compatibility layer for Linux / SteamOS, kind of the same *idea* as Proton but aimed at APKs instead of Windows games. For VR alone, that already makes sense. Android basically owns the VR app ecosystem right now, so if Valve wants their VR hardware to compete seriously, being able to run Android VR apps without ports is a huge win. But what keeps sticking in my head is the Linux desktop angle. Proton didn’t just help gaming on Linux it changed expectations. People stopped asking “does Linux have games?” and started asking “why wouldn’t this work?” If Lepton focuses more on apps than games, Linux could suddenly access a massive pool of Android apps that never had Linux ports in the first place. Productivity apps, indie tools, niche stuff that would never justify a native Linux version. And if Valve treats Lepton the same way they treated Proton (open, community-driven, iterative), then it’s not really Valve vs Microsoft or Valve vs anyone. It’s an ecosystem thing. That’s much harder to shut down or “compete away,” especially without looking hostile to users. I don’t think this means Linux suddenly replaces Windows or anything dramatic like that. Inertia is real. But I *do* think it could make Linux seriously competitive in a way it hasn’t been before especially as Windows keeps losing user trust and Steam Deck already showed that people are fine with Linux as long as it stays out of their way. Google is the wildcard here. Android spreading everywhere helps them, but losing control over distribution and services probably doesn’t. I’m really curious how they respond long-term. Maybe it’s nothing. Maybe it’s niche. But Proton felt niche once too. Curious what others think is Lepton just about VR, or could this turn into another slow but meaningful shift for Linux?",

    "title": "Wayland is flawed at its core and the community needs to talk about it",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Wayland bakes a paranoid security model directly into its protocol instead of using a sane capability system, breaks tons of important software (RenderDoc, xkill, automation tools, etc), solves threats that basically dont exist in practice, and projects like COSMIC arent even bothering with X11 support anymore. If X11 dies completely, entire workflows and niches are going with it. We either need Wayland to change its philosophy or start from scratch with something new. I've been daily driving Linux for about 5 years now. Not the longest time compared to some of you, but enough to understand why I'm here. I want to actually my computer. That's the whole reason. Windows kept doing stuff I didn't ask for, and Linux was the answer. So why does it feel like Wayland is trying to bring that same energy back? My core issue with Wayland is that it confuses security philosophy with protocol design. The developers decided early on that applications should be completely isolated from each other. One window cannot know anything about another window. An application cannot grab pixels from another application. Programs cannot position other programs windows. And before someone says \"but security!\", look: this isolation ISN'T a configurable security layer you can adjust based on your needs. Its THE fundamental architecture. When Wayland devs say \"we dont support feature X because security\", what they really mean is \"we designed ourselves into a corner and now we literally cant add this without breaking everything.\" You know how actual secure systems work? Capabilities. The Linux kernel does this with stuff like CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN or CAP\\_SYS\\_PTRACE. SELinux does this. AppArmor does this. Even Android, which is paranoid as hell about security, has a granular permission system where you can say \"yes this app can do this specific thing.\" Wayland could have been designed like a microkernel approach. Minimal core protocol, well defined extension points, capability system where compositors grant specific permissions to specific apps. Want your automation tool to see window positions? Grant it that capability. Screenshot tool needs to capture specific windows? Theres a capability for that. But no. Instead we got \"nobody can do anything unless we specifically designed a portal for it, and even then your compositor might not implement that portal, so good luck lmao.\" And I would shut up if that actually solved something, but it solves problems that dont really exist. Lets talk about what Wayland supposedly protects us from. The classic example is keyloggers: on X11, any application can read keystrokes from any other application. Sounds bad right? But think about it for a second. If malicious software is running on your system with your user permissions, you already lost. That application can read your files. It can access your browser cookies. It can modify your bashrc to capture passwords. It can install itself as a systemd user service. It can do literally anything you can do. The idea that preventing it from reading X11 events makes you meaningfully more secure is honestly a fantasy. The actual threat model where X11 isolation matters is basically nonexistent in the real world. Meanwhile, the restrictions that \"protect\" you from this theoretical threat break actual software that real people use every day. Not bad enough, there are a LOT of actual useful stuff that break down because of this. This is where I get actually frustrated. Here's software that just doesnt work properly under Wayland: **RenderDoc** is probably the most important graphics debugging tool out there. If you do anything with Vulkan or OpenGL, you need this. It works by injecting into the target process and capturing API calls. Wayland's security model makes this a nightmare. If youre a graphics dev on Linux, this alone should concern you. **Theres no xkill equivalent.** On X11, window freezes, you run xkill, click on it, its dead. Simple. Been working for decades. On Wayland you literally cannot do this in a compositor agnostic way because apps arent allowed to identify other windows. Each compositor has to roll their own solution, if they even bother. **xdotool and automation** are just gone. Completely broken. If you have scripts that automate window management, send keystrokes, position windows programatically.. Wayland says \"sorry, security risk\" and offers nothing in return. Years of workflow optimization just thrown away. **Global hotkeys** were broken for years. Discord push to talk? Didnt work. Media keys in some apps? Didnt work. Some of this got \"fixed\" through portals but its still fragmented and janky. **Screen recording and streaming** was a disaster for the longest time. OBS needed special backends for each compositor. Some compositors just didnt support it at all. Even now its worse than X11 for a lot of users. **Color management** only recently got addressed and tons of compositors still dont implement it right. If you do photography or video editing and need accurate colors, Wayland was literally unusable for years. Compatibility isn't even the real problem. When you bring this stuff up, people always say \"just wait, itll get better.\" And sure, some gaps are closing. XWayland exists. Portals are slowly adding features. But compatibility isnt my main concern. My concern is that Wayland's architecture means certain things will NEVER work, by design. The developers have said clearly they wont add features they consider security risks, even if users want them, even if users accept the tradeoff. And heres whats really worrying: new projects arent even bothering with X11 anymore. Look at COSMIC from System76. Its Wayland only. No X11 support, and they've said thats how its gonna stay. This is the future. More and more projects will go Wayland only, X11 support will slowly rot away, and eventually it wont be a choice anymore. If X11 truly dies and Wayland becomes the only option, entire categories of software and workflows will just cease to exist on Linux. Graphics debugging becomes second class. Automation requires compositor specific hacks forever. Power users who want actual control get told they cant have it. Look, I use linux because I want to control my computer. This is really what it comes down to for me. I didnt switch to Linux because I wanted my OS to protect me from myself. I switched because I wanted freedom. If I want an application to see other windows, that should be MY decision. If I want to run automation scripts, thats MY choice. If I want to accept a theoretical security risk in exchange for functionality I actually need, that should be up to ME. Wayland treats users like threats to their own systems. It assumes you cant be trusted to make decisions about what software can do on your own computer. This is Windows mentality. This is Apple mentality. This is exactly what Linux was supposed to be an escape from. # So what now I think theres really only two paths forward. Either Wayland fundamentally changes its philosophy and adopts something like capability based permissions, or we need to start working on a new display protocol from scratch that actually learns from both X11 and Wayland's mistakes. The current path where X11 slowly dies while Wayland remains hostile to power users is not sustainable. We're going to loose important niches. We're going to drive away developers who need functionality Wayland refuses to provide. We're going to make Linux worse in the name of security theater. X11 had real problems, I'm not denying that. It was old, full of cruft, the rendering model was showing its age. A replacement was probably needed. But Wayland aint it. It prioritized a flawed security model over user freedom, and now we're all paying for it. I really hope I'm wrong about this. I hope the Wayland devs eventually realize that treating users as adversaries isnt the way. But based on every discussion I've seen, they seem completely committed to this path. And honestly that scares me about where Linux on the desktop is heading, because this looks exactly what Microsoft or Apple do, prohibiting their users from doing stuff in their own operational systems.",

    "title": "Is Linux losing its soul? The shift from \"Open by Default\" to Corporate Control (Red Hat, Canonical)",
    "selftext": "I’ve been watching the transition to Wayland, systemd and the general direction of modern Linux, and I feel like we are ignoring the elephant in the room. The problem isn't just that Wayland is \"missing features\" or that screen recording is hard, the problem is the fundamental philosophical shift happening right now. We are moving from an OS that trusts the user to an OS that treats the user like a liability. ...The Death of \"Open by Default\" The core philosophy of Unix/Linux used to be, The user is the master. If I want to run a script that automates my mouse, reads my screen, or modifies system files, the OS should obey. Yes, that means if I accidentally run a virus, it destroys my system. But that is my responsibility. Modern Linux is adopting a \"Zero Trust\" model. It isolates apps, restricts global hotkeys, and breaks automation tools by design. It feels like the developers are saying, \"We don't trust you to manage your own computer, so we're going to lock the doors for your own safety.\" I don't need a nanny state OS. If I run a command, it should execute. Period. ...Red Hat and Canonical are the new Google and Apple We like to pretend Linux is a \"community project,\" but let's be real. Red Hat (IBM): They pay the developers who maintain the Kernel, Systemd, and Wayland. Their goal is Enterprise Stability, not hacker freedom. They want an OS that is safe for banks and the military, even if that makes it annoying for power users. Canonical: They are trying to be Apple. Look at Snaps, a proprietary backend store, forced updates, and \"walled garden\" tactics. These giants are influencing open-source projects to fit their corporate liability needs. They are slowly turning the Linux desktop into something that resembles Android or macOS: a secure, restricted platform where you are a \"user,\" not an \"admin.\" ...\"Missing Features\" are actually \"Intentional Restrictions\" People ask why Wayland is still missing basic features after 15 years. The answer is usually: \"That feature was insecure in X11, so we removed it.\" They aren't trying to fix X11, they are trying to sanitize it. We are losing the ability to deeply script and automate our environments because \"security\" has become more important than \"utility.\" I chose Linux because I wanted full control, the ability to break my system if I wanted to. If I wanted a isolated, \"safe\" experience where the OS decides what is good for me, I would use macOS. Are we okay with Linux becoming just another corporate-safe OS?",

    "title": "Orbitiny Desktop Pilot 8 Release - The Biggest and Most Significant Release Ever (To Date) - Now Also With a Graphical System-Wide Installer",
    "selftext": "Orbitiny Desktop is a new and innovative desktop environment for Linux bringing you exclusive features and functionalities unavailable in other desktop environments. These features include: desktop gestures, icon emblems for files on the clipboard (cut or copied), icon emblems for new or modified files, *icon emblems* for empty files and directories, multi-paste support, (pasting to multiple selected directories), dedicated icons for mounted and user account home directories, custom desktop directories, individual desktop directory per monitor, individual desktop directory per virtual desktop and a lot more! *All of these features are exclusive to Orbitiny only, and if you see anyone else doing the same thing, just know that you first saw it in* *Orbitiny Desktop*, a desktop that *focuses on functionality*, *features,*, *innovation* *and* *extensibility* *while keeping traditional and familiar appearance.* Due to its *superior* portable and modular design, Orbitiny can be run in portable mode (no installation required) *or* can be installed to any directory. To run it in portable mode, just launch the start-orbitiny script. In portable mode, all the settings will be saved in the directory the start-orbitiny script is in. You can then copy this folder to a USB stick, take it with you, go to another Linux computer and launch the script again and all the settings and configurations will still be there. As a system-wide desktop (non-portable mode), the settings will be saved to $HOME/.config/orbitiny for each user. https://preview.redd.it/s20b2uh7v0ag1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42116e342fe251bdd5a133977220a40530baa0f3 What's so special about this release? I have replaced / recoded nearly the entire foundation of the project. Users wanted a system-wide installation, many asked for it but originally Orbitiny was designed to be run as a portable guest-desktop only, a desktop on top of another and the existing instructions provided were pretty much a hack which did not work very well. In order to achieve what people asked for, I had go back to the drawing board, redesign the whole structure and scrap a huge amount of old code and redo the whole thing again while still keeping the original portability as an option. So, you can still run it as a portable desktop but now, you can also install it properly like any other desktop. Best of all? It won't put files all over your system. It installs in a folder/directory with all the files needed to run also installed in that directory. Next, I have detached a huge amount of code into separate apps not attached to the desktop. This means, if they crash, they won't take the desktop down and I am still not done yet, I will be spinning off the awesome clipboard manager that can also track and record files on the clipboard, not just text like all other ones. For instance, you can set file1 to the clipboard, then also set some text to the clipboard, open up the clipboard manager window and then you just double click on file1 to set it back to the clipboard OR grab the entry and drag it away from the clipboard manager's window into another application. I have created a proper foundation for theming, finally! Now Orbitiny can be properly themed however at this point of time, I have not developed a theme manager yet so if you want to change themes, you are going to have to set the theme via a config file. I have also extended the functionality of virtual desktops. Not only can you switch virtual desktops per se (and hide other windows), with Orbitiny you can also switch to different desktop directories when you click on a virtual desktop button so you can assign a desktop path per virtual desktop button. End result? It's like switching TV channels or a using an HDMI switcher or a different computer. Next, I have added a real-time monitor for the desktop's settings. So you can open up the config file (a plain ASCII Text/INI file) edit it, save it and the desktop detects the change and immediately applies the setting. For example, you can set a different desktop directory, change a wallpaper etc. A huge amount of bugs have been fixed (and there are more which will be fixed). Orbitiny is not a small project. It's huge and consists of 47 different components. 45 external programs (including the plugins) + 2 internal ones (the clipboard manager and the dashboard which will too be spun off). I created them all from scratch and I manage them all. It's a real desktop environment eco-system. So, I started this project due to my huge disappointment of the Linux desktop offerings back when I switched to Linux in 2014 and to this date, that disappointment still remains. As the developer of Orbitiny, I focus on functionality and innovation. # 1.0 Pilot 8 - Release Notes: **New Features:** * **New**: Implemented a brand new icon-driven Control Panel and spun off each configuration utility into its own independent module / app. This way if the spun-off configuration utility crashes, it won't take the entire desktop down (this wasn't the case in previous releases). * **New:** Implemented a **live/real-time** desktop settings monitoring. If the desktop's settings.ini file gets changed, the settings get applied immediately right after the file is saved. This is equivalent to some other DEs using a registry-like way of doing things in real-time except that Orbitiny uses traditional text files instead of human-unreadable binary blobs that only a computer can read. * **New:** Added an additional functionality to the Virtual Desktops applet for the panel (workspace switcher) - now when switching virtual desktops (1 2, 3 etc), not only will it hide windows and task buttons from other desktops, it will also switch to different desktop directories so you have a separate desktop directory per virtual desktop, it's like switching to a different computer literally. * **New:** Add a \"Mark as Safe\" option to the script action prompt dialog for script files. If the default option about what to do with script files has been set to \"Ask\", now you also have a \"Run & Mark as Safe\" button and the next time you run the script, you won't be prompted even if the default action is set to \"Ask\" in Orbitiny Desktop settings. This works by recording the checksum of the script in a file and the next time you launch the file, it checks to see if the checksum exists. * **New:** Added an \"Empty Folder/File\" icon emblem to Orbitiny's File Manager (Qutinty) file icons to empty directories. This will visually show you when a directory is empty. This way you don't have to go to open up Properties or navigate inside the folder to see if there is content. * **New:** Created an Orbitiny Desktop graphical installer for system-wide installaton and this way you can use Orbitiny as a standalone independent desktop. * **New:** Implemented automatic process restarting. If the panel or the desktop crash, they will automatically relaunch. This is especially vital when running Orbitiny as a stand-alone and independent desktop started from a display manager. So you won't be left with a blank X11 window in case of a crash. * **New**: Added liquid-like fluid/fade-in desktop effects to desktop icons when you hover over them. * **New**: Implemented a dynamic theme engine and a theme manager - themes are no longer static and styles can be modified by editing a CSS file on the disk * **New**: Added 3D-Like (Drop Shadow) text effect to desktop icons. To turn this On or Off, go to *Control Panel->Desktop Icons* and check/uncheck \"Use Drop Shadow Effect in Icon Captions\" * **New**: Added \"**Paste with rsync**\" option to the right-click context menus. When selected, it opens up a terminal window and copies the files using the **Rsync** utility. It's also getting passed to the \"**time**\" command so you can see how long it takes for the operation to complete * **New**: Created a Plugin Manager for Orbitiny Panel - Now you can keep adding plugins by double-clicking an on item in the Plugin Manager and close it when you are done with it. * **New**: Created a Theme Manager for Orbitiny Panel - As with the plugin manager, it's all in one window and you can apply themes just by double clicking on it or clicking the \"Apply\" button. There is also \"Rename\", \"Open Theme Directory\", \"Export Selected\", \"Delete Selected\" - all in one window so you no longer have to go through multiple menus / submenus (very troublesome and I was aware of it) just to select a theme. * **New**: Created a Panel Manager for Orbitiny Panel - Enables you to create, delete, rename, activate and deactivate panels via a simple toggle button from one central point as shown on the screenshot below. As with the theme management, gone are the times where you'd have to go through several clicks and submenus to get to the action you need (it even annoyed me) every time you need to manage a panel. * **New**: Created a Profile Manager for Orbitiny Panel - Enables you to create, delete, rename, activate and deactivate panel profiles. A panel profile is simply a panel directory with a set of various applet configurations. Each profile can have/hold a different set of applets and you can easily switch between. The ability to quickly access profiles by clicking the button on the right-hand side on the panel remains and will remain, it's a core feature. * **New**: Added **CTRL+Insert** keyboard shortcut as an alternative to **CTRL+C** for copying files. * **New:** Added \"**Set as Wallpaper**\" option to Orbitiny's file manager's (Qutiny) file context menu. * **New:** Completely redesigned the wallpaper selection utility. The old one uses the **Qutinty** file manager as a component to show thumbnails and it is a temporary work-around. The new one (see below) is properly designed from scratch and looks much better because it is designed to be a proper wallpaper picker, not a cut-down file manager showing files with thumbnails and using it as an image viewer. I had to do a lot of hacks to integrate Qutiny and get it to work as a wallpaper picker. * **New:** Implemented a brand new theme for the Orbitiny file manager (Qutiny), called Coconut * **New:** Fully intgerated the panel into the Orbitiny Desktop. Now when you drag-drop a folder/dir to it from a file manager/desktop or manually add it and you click on it, it will use the file manager set in Orbitiny's settings (done via the Control Panel) * **New:** Implemented a brand new Preferences dialog for Orbitiny's Panel following the new UI designs found in the Orbitiny Desktp's control panel * **New:** In the file manager, changed the default key-press action to filter items rather then selecting them. * **New:** Implemented a \"VIP Configuration Files\" list that when attempted to delete any of the files in the list, it warns you that the file you are about to delete is an important configuration file and it asks if you sure you want to continue. The list of files is read and loaded dynamically from a file called vip\\_files.conf and by default it consists of 11 files including .config, .local, Desktop and others. * **New:** Added a \"Desktop Background / Wallpaper\" menu entry to the Desktop's right-click context menu * **New:** Created a backend API for a global theme manager and exemplary demonstration (not finished yet) in Orbitiny's Control Panel->Appearance (again, this is an example only, far from finished) **Bug Fixes:** * **BugFix**: Fixed a delay/lag when desktop icons are repositioned/dragged to another tile/slot on the desktop * **BugFix**: Fixed a terrible panel resizing bug when panel is docked to the right-hand side of the screen and the user attempts to resize it by grabbing and holding panel's outer edge border * **BugFix**: FIxed an annoying (but easy to fix) intermittent file selection issue in Qutiny (Orbitiny's File Manager) - sometimes an item appears selected but when you click Ctrl+C/X to copy/paste or right click on it and select any action, you get an error message saying that 0 files are selected even though clearly there is a selection and clicking on it again to reselect the item does not fix the issue. This is now all fixed. * **BugFix**: Fixed a performance issue when a desktop wallpaper is used on high resolution screens displays * **BugFix**: Fixed a SysTray issue sometimes not appearing when its configuration is changed (The issue goes away after the panel is restarted) * **BugFix**: Fixed an issue when trying to adjust vertical applet spacing, it adjusts horizontal and vica versa * **BugFix**: Fixed an intermittent crash with the Orbitiny's Clipboard Manager when an item is double clicked to activte it and a consistent bug with HTML data not getting set on the clipboard * **BugFix**: Fixed a Drag&Drop error with desktop tiles (icons) - **intermittently** when you release an item over an empty area, it is mistakenly deemed as a valid non-blank item so the dragged-to-item popup menu would appear while referencing a wrong tile target. * **BugFix**: Fixed another Drag&Drop error with desktop icons - Sometimes when you attempted to resposition an icon to another avaiable tile, it would not work. This is now fixed ant it is butterly smooth. * **BugFix**: Fixed a panel Drag&Drop crashing bug when you drag a file to it to add it * **BugFix**: Fixed popup menus appearing in the wrong screen position when invoked via desktop gestures * **BugFix**: Fixed desktop icon tile repositioning - Sometimes when trying to reposition a desktop icon, it would fail the first time (and sometimes the second. It is now fixed). * **BugFix**: Fixed a horizontal panel length issue with the panel when docked from a vertical position to a horizontal position. * **BugFix**: Fixed a panel resing issue when the panel is docked to the top of the screen and you try to grab the panel outer edge border and resize it * **BugFix**: Fixed a Clipboard Manager issue not working when text is copied to the clipboard (only worked with files and images) * **BugFix**: Fixed another Clipboard Manager issue - when the Clipboard Manager is shown and item is added to the clipboard, the item height added to the window is super large * **BugFix**: Fixed an issue with the panel audio applet not working. * **BugFix**: Fixed being unable to delete a custom application entry in right-click \"Open With\" context submenus * **BugFix**: Fixed \"**S**how Disks and Partitions Menu\" and \"Show Designated Directories Menu\" configuration change not being obeyed on the desktop * **BugFix**: Fixed an intermittent issue in Qutiny file manager where it mistakenly loads a preview when an image is clicked but in fact, preview is turned off (intermittent issue). * **BugFix**: Fixed an intermittent crash with the \"Run Command\" combo box in Orbitiny Desktop's context menu * **BugFix**: Fixed the old broken \"Empty Trash Can\" dialog being invoked when \"Empty Trash Can\" is selected * **BugFix**: Fixed an intermittent bug with desktop icon filtering. Sometimes when you hit a key to start desktop icon filtering, the search filter pops up on the screen but the initial character you pressed would not be inserted. This is definitively fixed. * **BugFix**: Fixed a very difficult to catch and very annoying intermittent crash triggered by std::string throwing std::bad\\_alloc affecting all components * **BugFix**: Fixed a \"Detecting devices\" toast message not disappearing in Orbitiny Device Manager on start up * **BugFix**: Fixed a file move issue - When moving files, user was not prompted to overwrite / replace exisiting files * **BugFix**: Fixed a high CPU usage (1%-2% while idling) in Orbitiny's File Manager (Qutinty) * **BugFix**: Fixed small step icon size adjustments in the file browser when adjusting using the mouse wheel * **BugFix**: Fixed a \"Move to Screen\" issue - if the panel is docked to the bottom of the screen and you try to move it to a screen with a higher display resolution, it miscalculated the other's screen's height so the panel ended up a floating instead of being docked * **BugFix**: Fixed various graphical theme issues such as some applets having inconsistent sizes (albeit about 2-3 pixels, it is there and I wanted it fixed) \\*\\* Application Porting \\*\\* * **Audio Control**: Ported **pavucontrol-qt** (from LXQt) to Orbitiny. I have been working every day for well over a month for this release and people that follow me on the Orbitiny subreddit are well aware of what I've been doing as I have been providing regular updates. Subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbitiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbitiny/) YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/@Orbitiny-Linux](https://www.youtube.com/@Orbitiny-Linux) \\- here you can see some of the features I have described here. Download: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/files/latest/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/files/latest/download) Source Code: [https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop](https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop) The new code will ready within 24 hours as I am now very, very tired and I need to get a break because a lot of things have changed. Also, a special announcement: Orbitiny Linux is coming and I am about to launch [orbitiny.org/](http://orbitiny.org/) | [orbitiny.com](http://orbitiny.com) and [orbitiny.net](http://orbitiny.net) (still no working website yet but it is coming). P.S. I apologize in advance for any bugs you may find, just report it and I will do everything I can to fix it.",
