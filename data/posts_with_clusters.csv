calculus I mean lets stick to doing mod 5 arithmetic throughout this post We can take a polynomial like x3  3x2  2x and differentiate it the same symbolic way we would if were we doing calculus normally to get 3x2  6x  2 However because were doing mod 5 arithmetic that 6x can be rewritten as just x so our derivative is 3x2  x  2 Why on Earth would you want to do this There is a slightly more concrete motivation at the end of this post but let me say a theoretical reason you might try this At the beginning of modern algebraic geometry Grothendieck and his school were incredibly motivated by the Weil conjectures Roughly French mathematician Andre Weil made the great observation that if you take a shape defined by a polynomial equation like the parabola y  x2 or like an elliptic curve y2  x3  x  1 then the geometry of its graph over the complex numbers and the number of solutions it has over finite fields a certain generalization of modular arithmetic are related Phrased differently if you graph an equation over the complex numbers you get a genuine geometric object with interesting geometry if you graph an equation in modular arithmetic you get some finite set of points because there are only 5 possible values of x and y when youre doing mod 5 arithmetic say At first you might imagine the rich geometry over the complex numbers is completely unrelated to the finite sets of points you get in modular arithmetic but by computing tons of examples Weil observed that theres a strange connection between the sizes of these finite sets and the geometry over the complex numbers Grothendieck and his students were trying with all of their might to understand why Weils observations were true and prove them rigorously Weil himself realized that the path towards understanding this connection was to build what we now call a Weil cohomology theory  that is find some way to take a shape in modular arithmetic and access the cohomology a certain very important geometric invariant of its complex numbers counterpart Georges de Rham in his famous de Rham theorem noticed that calculus actually gives you a spectacularly simple way to access the geometry of a shape or more precisely its cohomology through the study of certain differential equations on that shape Thus Grothendieck and others set about developing a theory of calculus in modular arithmetic so that they could ultimately understand differential equations in modular arithmetic and therefore understand cohomology of graphs of functions in modular arithmetic Unfortunately this vision encounters a large difficulty at the very start In normal calculus the only functions whose derivative is zero are the constant functions But in mod 5 calculus it turns out that nonconstant functions can have derivative zero For instance x5 is certainly a nonzero function but its derivative 5x4 is zero modulo 5 This means that in modular arithmetic simple differential equations have many more solutions than their usual counterparts For example the differential equation dfdx  2fx when solved in normal calculus has solution fx  Cx2 for a constant C But in mod 5 calculus this differential equation has many solutions x2 is one such solution just like in normal calculus but x7 x12 x17  are all solutions as well This means that if you apply de Rhams original procedure to go from differential equations to cohomology you end up getting much much bigger cohomology in modular arithmetic than you do in usual geometry Grothendieck ended up solving this with the theory of crystalline cohomology but it was a big obstacle to overcome  Theres an earlier post I wrote on rmath about homotopical reasoning see   These two posts might seem unrelated at first but surprisingly they are not to do calculus in positive characteristic it turns out you really need homotopical math As an algebraic geometer this was actually my original motivation for learning homotopical thinking For a more down to earth

resources so first things first I want to open up applications for new mods for rprogramming If youre interested please start by reading the State of the Subreddit May 2024 post for the reasoning behind the current rulesets then leave a comment below with the word application somewhere in it so that I can tell it apart from the memes In there please give at least  Why you want to be a mod

free of rulebreaking content and then for feedback on changes that we could start making to the rules and content mix Ive been procrastinating this for a while so wish me luck Well probably make some mistakes at first so try to give us the benefit of the doubt  Rules update Not much is changing about the rules since last time except for a few things most of which I said last time I was keeping an eye on   Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming Its gotten out of hand and our users hate it I thought it was a brief fad but its been 2 years and its still going   Newsletters I

the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place  means that its currently allowed  means that its not currently allowed  means that we leave it up

heres how As said above true technical writeups of a codebase or demonstrations of a technique or samples of interesting code in the wild are absolutely welcome and encouraged All links to projects must include what makes them technically interesting not just what they do or a feature list or that you spent all night making it The technical writeup must be the focus of the post not just a tickbox checking exercise to get us to allow it This is a technical subreddit not Product Hunt We dont care what you built we care how you build it   AskReddit type forum questions Whats your favourite programming language Tabs or spaces Does anyone else hate it when   Support questions How do I write a web crawler How do I get into programming Wheres my missing semicolon Please do this obvious homework problem for me Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because theyd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low   Surveys and  Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself   Meta posts DAE think rprogramming sucks Why did you remove my post Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear Im just asking questions Except this meta post This one is okay because Im a tyrant that the rules dont apply to I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now   Images memes anything loweffort or lowcontent Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so theres not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because its easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper   Posts that wed normally allow but that are obviously unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copypasted onto a site with a bazillion ads It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if theyre the best discussion going on about the news event Theres a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular there are a lot of spammy security blogs that syndicate stories like this   Extreme beginner content What is a variable What is a for loop Making an HTPT request using curl Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged   Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion   Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory  Comments are only very loosely moderated and its mostly  Bots of any kind Beep boop you misspelled misspelled and  Incivility You idiot everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have   vibe coding articles I tried vibe coding you guys is apparently a hot topic right now If theyre contentless well try to be on them under the general quality rule but were leaving them alone for now if they have anything to actually say Were not explicitly banning the category but you are encouraged to vote on them as you see fit   Corporate blogs simply describing their product in the guise of what is an authorisation framework Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it Companies use their blogs as marketing branding and recruiting tools and thats okay when its writing a good article will make people think of us but it doesnt go here if its just a literal advert Usually they are titled in a way that I dont spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments rprogrammings mission is to be the place with the highest quality programming content where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day In general rulefollowing posts will stay up even if subjectively they arent that great We want to default to allowing things rather than intervening on quality grounds except LLM output etc and let the votes take over On rprogramming the voting arrows mean show me more like this We use them to drive rules changes So please vote away Because of this were not especially worried about categories just because they have a lot of very lowscoring posts that sit at the bottom of the hot page and are never seen by anybody If youve scrolled that far its because you went through the higherscoring stuff already and wed rather show you that than show you nothing On the other hand sometimes rulebreaking posts arent obvious from just the title so also dont be shy about reporting rulebreaking content when you see it Try to leave some context in the report reason a lot of spammers report everything else to drown out the spam reports on their stuff so the presence of one or two reports is often not enough to alert us since sometimes everything is reported Theres an unspoken metarule here that the other rules are built on which is that all content should point outward That is it should provide more value to the community than it provides to the poster Anything thats looking to extract value from the community rather than provide it is disallowed even without an explicit rule about it This is what drives the prohibition on job postings surveys feedback requests and partly on support questions Another important metarule is that mechanically its not easy for a subreddit to say well allow 5 of the content to be support questions So for anything that we allow we must be aware of types of content that beget more of themselves Allowing memes and CS student homework questions will pretty quickly turn the subreddit into only memes and CS student homework questions leaving no room for the subreddits actual mission,State of the Subreddit January 2027 Mods applications and rules updates

people showing off something they worked on Thats cool but its not programming content  The rules With all of that here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place  means that its currently allowed  means that its not currently allowed  means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early  means that Im not making a ruling on it today but its a category were keeping an eye on   Actual programming content They probably have actual code in them Language or library writeups papers technology descriptions How an allocator works How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works How our startup built our Frobnicator For many years this was the only category of allowed content   Academic CS or programming papers   Programming news ChatGPT can write code A big new CVE just dropped Curl 801 released now with Coffee over IP support   Programmer career content How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days Habits of the best engineering managers These must be related or specific to programmingsoftware engineering careers in some way   Articlesnews interesting to programmers but not about programming Work from home is bullshit Return to office is bullshit Theres a Steam sale on programming games Terry Davis has died How to SCRUMM App Store commissions are

collapsing Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment Meta cancels work from home Gnome dropped a feature I like How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of uh cats yeah its definitely just for cats A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local   Anything clearly written mostly by an LLM If you dont want to write it we dont want to read it   Politics The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden Please vote for net neutrality Big Tech is being sued in Europe

is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form Stack Overflow sucks now Stack Overflow is good actually   Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming Its gotten out of hand and our users hate it   Newsletters Listicles or anything else that just aggregates other content If you found 15 open source projects that will blow my mind post those 15 projects instead and well be the judge of that   Demos without code I wrote a game come buy it Please give me feedback on my startup totally not an ad nosirree I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor heres the pricing page I made a DALLE image generator I made the fifteenth animation of A this week heres a GIF   Project demos I made this Previously called demos with code These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo   Project technical writups I made this and heres how As said above true technical writeups of a codebase or demonstrations of a technique or samples of interesting code in the wild are absolutely welcome and encouraged All links to projects must include what makes them technically interesting not just what they do or a feature list or that you spent all night making it The technical writeup must be the focus of the post not just a tickbox checking exercise to get us to allow it This is a technical subreddit not Product Hunt We dont care what you built we care how you build it   AskReddit type forum questions Whats your favourite programming language Tabs or spaces Does anyone else hate it when   Support questions How do I write a web crawler How do I get into programming Wheres my missing semicolon Please do this obvious homework problem for me Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because theyd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low   Surveys and  Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself   Meta posts DAE think rprogramming sucks Why did you remove my post Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear Im just asking questions Except this meta post This one is okay because Im a tyrant that the rules dont apply to I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now   Images memes anything loweffort or lowcontent Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so theres not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because its easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper   Posts that wed normally allow but that are obviously unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copypasted onto a site with a bazillion ads It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if theyre the best discussion going on about the news event Theres a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular there are a lot of spammy security blogs that syndicate stories like this   Extreme beginner content What is a variable What is a for loop Making an HTPT request using curl Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged   Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion   Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory  Comments are only very loosely moderated and its mostly  Bots of any kind Beep boop you misspelled misspelled and  Incivility You idiot everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have   vibe coding articles I tried vibe coding you guys is apparently a hot topic right now If theyre contentless well try to be on them under the general quality rule but were leaving them alone for now if they have anything to actually say Were not explicitly banning the category but you are encouraged to vote on them as you see fit   Corporate blogs simply describing their product in the guise of what is an authorisation framework Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it Companies use their blogs as marketing branding and recruiting tools and thats okay when its writing a good article will make people think of us but it doesnt go here if its just a literal advert Usually they are titled in a way that I dont spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments rprogrammings mission is to be the place with the highest quality programming content where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day In general rulefollowing posts will stay up even if subjectively they arent that great We want to default to allowing things rather than intervening on quality grounds except LLM output etc and let the votes take over On rprogramming the voting arrows mean show me more like this We use them to drive rules changes So please vote away Because of this were not especially worried about categories just because they have a lot of very lowscoring posts that sit at the bottom of the hot page and are never seen by anybody If youve scrolled that far its because you went through the higherscoring stuff already and wed rather show you that than show you nothing On the other hand sometimes rulebreaking posts arent obvious from just the title so also dont be shy about reporting rulebreaking content when you see it Try to leave some context in the report reason a lot of spammers report everything else to drown out the spam reports on their stuff so the presence of one or two reports is often not enough to alert us since sometimes everything is reported Theres an unspoken metarule here that the other rules are built on which is that all content should point outward That is it should provide more value to the community than it provides to the poster Anything thats looking to extract value from the community rather than provide it is disallowed even without an explicit rule about it This is what drives the prohibition on job postings surveys feedback requests and partly on support questions Another important metarule is that mechanically its not easy for a subreddit to say well allow 5 of the content to be support questions So for anything that we allow we must be aware of types of content that beget more of themselves Allowing memes and CS student homework questions will pretty quickly turn the subreddit into only memes and CS student homework questions leaving no room for the subreddits actual mission,"[-0.04704957  0.03383008  0.04179134 ...  0.01646101  0.04692287

chapter it doesnt have to be a main plot point but it should be more than a passing mention  Worth 15 points To mourn is to grieve that which we can no longer have be that a loved one a rare opportunity or something we can no longer do to mourn is to begin the process of accepting that loss Mourning is typically thought of as a somber affair but it isnt always weeping or depressed melancholy There are as many different ways to mourn as there are people Some choose to work through their pain via labour processing their woes as they do so Some choose to work through it alone

]",HR Empty Mailbox,My arms yanked the door open the hinges groaning loudly as I slipped outside into the front yard The wind was cool against my neck as it followed me down the narrow path towards the bin The grass was long overdue for its trim and I wondered whether Scott was free this afternoon to tame down the jungle that happened to be mistaken as our front yard The bin was light bearing the weight of only one persons trash now Claire hadnt been around for the past few weeks As the bin rolled drunkenly down with me towards the fence I turned over to look at the mailbox It was always bursting with all kinds of news boring catalogues happy postcards from family and occasionally a notice for pest control in the unit I paced over towards the mailbox It was best to empty the contents into the bin before the garbage truck came as it always did at 8 am The sun hovered slightly over the horizon its beams arguing with the winds pleas to watch over my shoulder The birds had only just begun singing their melodies and my body ached to crawl back under the covers The letters slid between my fingers a Woolworths catalogue a drawing of a panda eating ice cream from my brother and underneath what seemed to be more letters from family Eventually I decided to keep the letters A panda eating ice cream would be an ideal decoration for a room that was in dire need of colour As I headed back inside my eyes diverted once more towards the letters hanging from my fingers which were beckoning my attention again It only took one second for my eyes to pause as my hands froze into a tight grip around one envelope The letters became soft under my touch as my hands grew increasingly sweaty and goosebumps formed along my arms There was nothing special about the envelope itself it was a basic envelope with no designs and a simple stamp But it was the name written messily at the bottom A name I had only ever heard in latenight conversations and messy phone calls A name I had never met before but was so familiar to my ears Not a name that belonged to me but one that had belonged to Claire My heart stuttered and my fingers twitched to lift open the seal I scanned the cover for any hints that would reveal the contents of this envelope but the only thing was a lilythemed stamp a huge URGENT and an address and name that belonged to Claires father My index finger repeatedly lifted the seal an inch before placing it back down once again and eventually a small crease formed on the seal The letter inside almost shone through the envelope forcing my eyes to shift towards it continuously I needed to know what it said I needed to see it before Claire did But it was wrong I couldnt just go through her mail Yet my mind kept telling me I was doing it for her I was only going to read the message so I could prepare for Claires reaction when she saw it too Then I could comfort her with tubs of ice cream and a tower of blankets Or I could protect her from the truth and never let her tired eyes reach the dreadful words that eagerly waited to attack her Either way I needed to be there for her That meant I needed to read this message But would she get mad Would I be invading her privacy A little part of me was purely just curious with no intent of comforting Claire or even acknowledging that I had read the letter The drama had attracted me like a mosquito yearning for droplets of blood to cease its starvation I walked over to the drawer carefully opening it and quietly rifling through its contents I felt like a thief in my own home sliding over the creaky floorboards so as not to disturb the choking calm of the air surrounding me The object reached my hands and as the torch was pulled out slowly my fingers flicked on the switch Instinctively I moved the torch to the back of the envelope and moved it around a sly attempt to decipher the words But it was folded many times and the words remained hidden by innocence It was almost a sudden movement I couldnt stop my mind The seal was now lifted with a few rips on the side and the letter lay bare for my eyes I need more money Claire I promise you this time its for food Love Dad 15 words that I had been so desperate to see 15 words that seemed to come every month from him yet were never true I knew Claires dad I knew his drug problem I knew he didnt truly care for Claire and I knew he was lying So my hands moved in evil gestures ripping the paper into small shreds and my legs walked me towards the door The hinges groaned loudly again as I opened the door but the wind blew harder almost dragging me by the hair towards the bin The lid flew open almost as if the wind knew everything The pieces of paper calmly drifted towards the bottomless pit and I headed back inside The mailbox was empty The next time I checked the mailbox it was bursting with mail again The lawn was still long and untrimmed as it brushed against my legs There was a message from Claires mother I opened this one immediately It was a funeral notice for Thursday Her father was dead I knew Claire was inside peacefully watching Friends on the TV Her mind had rested ever since she hadnt heard from her father about money She had told me how pleased she was that he was improving and I nodded along with her meaningless statement At least shell never get a letter again Maybe its better not to know anything Im the

]",AA Lost in Amazonia,Journal Entry 27 We passed through the barrier and entered the darkness on the other side I woke up and all I see is the canopy high above me The trees are so tall that I cant even see where they end Not even the sky I remember not knowing where I was at first I couldnt even remember how Id ended up in this rainforest I hear Amandas voice and I see her and Julio standing over me I barely remembered who they were I think they knew that because Amanda then asks me if I know where we are I take a look around and all I see is the rainforest Were surrounded on all sides by a neverending maze of almost identical trees Large and unusually shaped with twisted trunks and branches like the bodies of snakes Everything is dim Not dark but dim It all comes back to me by now The river The rainforest We were here to document the uncontacted tribes I take another look around and I realise were right bang in the middle of the rainforest as if wed already been trekking through it I asked Amanda and Julio where the barrier had gone but they just ask me the same thing They didnt know They said all three of us woke up on the forest floor but I didnt wake for another good hour This doesnt make any sense Im starting to freak out Amanda and Julio have to keep calming me down Without knowing where we are weve decided that we need to find which way the rest of the expedition went Amanda said they wouldve tried to find a way back to the barrier and so we need to head south The only problem is we dont know which way south is The forest is too dark and we cant even use the sun because we cant see it The only way we can find south is to guess Journal Entry 28 Following what we hoped was south we walked for hours through the dimness of the rainforest continually having to climb over the large roots of trees and although the ground is flat we feel as though weve been going up a continual incline As the hours continue to go by me Amanda and Julio begin to notice the same things Every tree we pass is almost identical in a way They were the same size same shape and even the same sort of contortion But what is even stranger to us stranger than the identical trees was the sound There is no sound none at all No macaws in the trees No monkeys howling Even by our feet there is no insect life of any kind The only sound comes from us From our footsteps our exhausted breathes Its as if nothing lives here As if nothing even exists on this side of the barrier Journal Entry 29 Although we know something is seriously wrong with this part of the rainforest we have no choice but to continue either to find the others or find our way back to the river Were so exhausted we have already lost count of the number of days Had it been two Three I feel as though Ive reached my breaking point Id been slacking behind the others for the past day I cant feel my legs anymore Only pain I struggle to breathe with the humidity and Ive already used up all my water supply Im too scared to sleep through the night On this side of the barrier Im afraid the dreams will be far more intense Through the dim daylight of the forest Im not sure if I was seeing things hearing things The only thing that fuels me to keep going is pure survival Journal Entry 30 It all became too much for me The pain The exhaustion The heat Today I decided I was done By the huge roots of some tree I collapsed down knowing I wouldnt be getting up anytime soon Realising I wasnt behind them Amanda and Julio came back for me They berate me to get back on my feet and start walking but I tell them I couldnt carry on I just needed time to rest Hoping the two of them would be somewhat understanding thats when they suddenly start screaming at me They accused me of not taking responsibility and that all this mess was my fault They were blaming me Too tired to argue I simply tell them to fuck off Expecting Julio to punch my lights out he instead tackles me hard to the floor Ive never been much of a fighter but when I try and fight back thats when he puts me in a choke hold and starts squeezing I cant breathe and I can already feel myself losing oxygen Just as everythings about to go to black Amanda effortlessly breaks him off of me While she tries to calm Julio down I do all I can just to get my breath back And just as I think Im safe from losing consciousness I then feel something underneath me Amanda and Julio realise Ive stumbled onto something and they come over to help me brush everything away What we discover beneath the leaves and soil is an old and very long metal fence lining the forest floor which eventually ends at some broken hinges Further down the fence Amanda then finds a sign A big red sign on the fence with words written on it It was hard to read because of the rust but Julio said the word read PELIGRO which is Spanish for DANGER Weve now made camp tonight where weve discussed the metal fence in full Amanda suggested the fence may have been put there for some sort of containment That maybe inside this part of the rainforest was some deadly disease and thats why we hadnt come across any animal life But if that was true why was the fence this far in Why wasnt it where the barrier was It just doesnt make sense Amanda then suggests we may even have crossed into another dimension and thats why the forest is now uninhabited and could maybe explain why we passed out upon entering We dont have any answers Just theories Journal Entry 31 We trekked through the forest again day and our food supply is running dangerously low We may have used up all our water but the invisible sky provides us with enough rain to soak up whatever we can from the leaves I never knew how good water could taste Nothing seems like it can get any worse This side of the rainforest is just a neverending labyrinth of the same fucking trees over and over Every day is just the same Walk through the forest Rest at night Fucking Groundhog Day We might as well be walking in circles But thats when Amanda came up with a plan Her plan was to climb up a tree until we found ourselves at the very top in the hopes of finding any sign of a way out I grew up in Manchester I had never even seen trees this big But the tree was easy enough to climb because of its irregular shape The only problem was we didnt know if the treetops even ended Theyre like massive bloody beanstalks We start climbing the tree and we mustve been climbing for about half an hour before we gave up Journal Entry 32 Amanda and Julio think we have the answers and even though I know we dont I let them keep on believing it For some reason Im too afraid to tell them about my dreams Maybe they also have the same dreams but like me choose to keep it to themselves But I need answers Journal Entry 33 Last night I chose not to sleep We usually take turns during the night to keep watch but I decided to stay up the whole night All night I stare into the pure black darkness around just wondering what the hell is out there waiting for us I stare into the darkness and its as if the darkness is just staring back at me Laughing at me Whatever brought us into this place it must be watching us Its probably the earliest hours of the morning now and pure darkness is still all around us Like every night in this place its dead quiet The rainforest is never supposed to be quiet at night Thats when its most alive I now hear something Its so faint but I can only just hear it It must be far away Maybe my sleep deprivation is causing me to hear things again But the sound seems to be getting louder just so slightly Like someones turning up a car radio inch by inch The sound is clearer to me now but I cant even describe it Its like a vibration getting louder ever so slightly I know I have to soon wake up the others Its getting closer It seems to be coming from all around us,AA Lost in Amazonia Journal Entry 27 We passed through the barrier and entered the darkness on the other side I woke up

snakes Everything is dim Not dark but dim It all comes back to me by now The river The rainforest We were here to document the uncontacted tribes I take another look around and I realise were right bang in the middle of the rainforest as if wed already been trekking through it I asked Amanda and Julio where the barrier had gone but they just ask me the same thing They didnt know They said all three of us woke up on the forest floor but I didnt wake for another good hour This doesnt make any sense Im starting to freak out Amanda and Julio have to keep calming me down Without knowing where we are weve decided that we need to find which way the rest of the expedition went Amanda said they wouldve tried to find a way back to the barrier and so we need to head south The only problem is we dont know which way south is The forest is too dark and we cant even use the sun because we cant see it The only way we can find south is to guess Journal Entry 28 Following what we hoped was south we walked for hours through the dimness of the rainforest continually having to climb over the large roots of trees and although the ground is flat we feel as though weve been going up a continual incline As the hours continue to go by me Amanda and Julio begin to notice the same things Every tree we pass is almost identical in a way They were the same size same shape and even the same sort of contortion But what is even stranger to us stranger than the identical trees was the sound There is no sound none at all No macaws in the trees No monkeys howling Even by our feet there is no insect life of any kind The only sound comes from us From our footsteps our exhausted breathes Its as if nothing lives here As if nothing even exists on this side of the barrier Journal Entry 29 Although we know something is seriously wrong with this part of the rainforest we have no choice but to continue either to find the others or find our way back to the river Were so exhausted we have already lost count of the number of days Had it been two Three I feel as though Ive reached my breaking point Id been slacking behind the others for the past day I cant feel my legs anymore Only pain I struggle to breathe with the humidity and Ive already used up all my water supply Im too scared to sleep through the night On this side of the barrier Im afraid the dreams will be far more intense Through the dim daylight of the forest Im not sure if I was seeing things hearing things The only thing that fuels me to keep going is pure survival Journal Entry 30 It all became too much for me The pain The exhaustion The heat Today I decided I was done By the huge roots of some tree I collapsed down knowing I wouldnt be getting up anytime soon Realising I wasnt behind them Amanda and Julio came back for me They berate me to get back on my feet and start walking but I tell them I couldnt carry on I just needed time to rest Hoping the two of them would be somewhat understanding thats when they suddenly start screaming at me They accused me of not taking responsibility and that all this mess was my fault They were blaming me Too tired to argue I simply tell them to fuck off Expecting Julio to punch my lights out he instead tackles me hard to the floor Ive never been much of a fighter but when I try and fight back thats when he puts me in a choke hold and starts squeezing I cant breathe and I can already feel myself losing oxygen Just as everythings about to go to black Amanda effortlessly breaks him off of me While she tries to calm Julio down I do all I can just to get my breath back And just as I think Im safe from losing consciousness I then feel something underneath me Amanda and Julio realise Ive stumbled onto something and they come over to help me brush everything away What we discover beneath the leaves and soil is an old and very long metal fence lining the forest floor which eventually ends at some broken hinges Further down the fence Amanda then finds a sign A big red sign on the fence with words written on it It was hard to read because of the rust but Julio said the word read PELIGRO which is Spanish for DANGER Weve now made camp tonight where weve discussed the metal fence in full Amanda suggested the fence may have been put there for some sort of containment That maybe inside this part of the rainforest was some deadly disease and thats why we hadnt come across any animal life But if that was true why was the fence this far in Why wasnt it where the barrier was It just doesnt make sense Amanda then suggests we may even have crossed into another dimension and thats why the forest is now uninhabited and could maybe explain why we passed out upon entering We dont have any answers Just theories Journal Entry 31 We trekked through the forest again day and our food supply is running dangerously low We may have used up all our water but the invisible sky provides us with enough rain to soak up whatever we can from the leaves I never knew how good water could taste Nothing seems like it can get any worse This side of the rainforest is just a neverending labyrinth of the same fucking trees over and over Every day is just the same Walk through the forest Rest at night Fucking Groundhog Day We might as well be walking in circles But thats when Amanda came up with a plan Her plan was to climb up a tree until we found ourselves at the very top in the hopes of finding any sign of a way out I grew up in Manchester I had never even seen trees this big But the tree was easy enough to climb because of its irregular shape The only problem was we didnt know if the treetops even ended Theyre like massive bloody beanstalks We start climbing the tree and we mustve been climbing for about half an hour before we gave up Journal Entry 32 Amanda and Julio think we have the answers and even though I know we dont I let them keep on believing it For some reason Im too afraid to tell them about my dreams Maybe they also have the same dreams but like me choose to keep it to themselves But I need answers Journal Entry 33 Last night I chose not to sleep We usually take turns during the night to keep watch but I decided to stay up the whole night All night I stare into the pure black darkness around just wondering what the hell is out there waiting for us I stare into the darkness and its as if the darkness is just staring back at me Laughing at me Whatever brought us into this place it must be watching us Its probably the earliest hours of the morning now and pure darkness is still all around us Like every night in this place its dead quiet The rainforest is never supposed to be quiet at night Thats when its most alive I now hear something Its so faint but I can only just hear it It must be far away Maybe my sleep deprivation is causing me to hear things again But the sound seems to be getting louder just so slightly Like someones turning up a car radio inch by inch The sound is clearer to me now but I cant even describe it Its like a vibration getting louder ever so slightly I know I have to soon wake up the others Its getting closer It seems to be coming from all around us,"[ 0.0179706   0.02239666
