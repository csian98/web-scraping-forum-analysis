1r4vmyi,LLMs for data pipelines without losing control API  DuckDB in 10 mins,Hey folks Ive been doing data engineering long enough to believe that real pipelines meant writing every parser by hand dealing with pagination myself and debugging nested JSON until it finally stopped exploding Ive also been pretty skeptical of the just prompt it approach Lately though Ive been experimenting with a workflow that feels less like hype and more like controlled engineering instead of starting with a blank pipelinepy I  start from a scaffold template already wired for pagination config patterns etc  feed the LLM structured docs  run it let it fail  paste the error back  fix in one tight loop  validate using metadata so Im checking what actually loaded LLM does the mechanical work I stay in charge of structure  validation AIassisted data ingestion Were doing a live session on Feb 17 to test this in real time going from empty folder  github commits dashboard duckdb  dlt  marimo and walking through the full loop live if youve got an annoying API weird pagination nested structures bad docs bring it thats more interesting than the happy path we wrote up the full workflow with examples here Curious whats the dealbreaker for you using LLMs in pipelines,user_f64187fa,1,0.52,5,2026-02-14 12:54:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r4vmyi/llms_for_data_pipelines_without_losing_control/,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r4vmyi/llms_for_data_pipelines_without_losing_control/,True,Discussion,self.datascience,datascience,False,False,"['data', 'work', 'test', 'start', 'just']"

1r4yrqo,Calculus in positive characteristic,Sometimes mathematicians like to do geometry in modular arithmetic That is doing geometry but instead of using real numbers as your coordinates using numbers modulo 5 for example as your coordinates Calculus is one of the most useful tools in geometry so its natural to ask if we can use it in modular arithmetic geometry As an example of the kind of calculus I mean lets stick to doing mod 5 arithmetic throughout this post We can take a polynomial like x3  3x2  2x and differentiate it the same symbolic way we would if were we doing calculus normally to get 3x2  6x  2 However because were doing mod 5 arithmetic that 6x can be rewritten as just x so our derivative is 3x2  x  2 Why on Earth would you want to do this There is a slightly more concrete motivation at the end of this post but let me say a theoretical reason you might try this At the beginning of modern algebraic geometry Grothendieck and his school were incredibly motivated by the Weil conjectures Roughly French mathematician Andre Weil made the great observation that if you take a shape defined by a polynomial equation like the parabola y  x2 or like an elliptic curve y2  x3  x  1 then the geometry of its graph over the complex numbers and the number of solutions it has over finite fields a certain generalization of modular arithmetic are related Phrased differently if you graph an equation over the complex numbers you get a genuine geometric object with interesting geometry if you graph an equation in modular arithmetic you get some finite set of points because there are only 5 possible values of x and y when youre doing mod 5 arithmetic say At first you might imagine the rich geometry over the complex numbers is completely unrelated to the finite sets of points you get in modular arithmetic but by computing tons of examples Weil observed that theres a strange connection between the sizes of these finite sets and the geometry over the complex numbers Grothendieck and his students were trying with all of their might to understand why Weils observations were true and prove them rigorously Weil himself realized that the path towards understanding this connection was to build what we now call a Weil cohomology theory  that is find some way to take a shape in modular arithmetic and access the cohomology a certain very important geometric invariant of its complex numbers counterpart Georges de Rham in his famous de Rham theorem noticed that calculus actually gives you a spectacularly simple way to access the geometry of a shape or more precisely its cohomology through the study of certain differential equations on that shape Thus Grothendieck and others set about developing a theory of calculus in modular arithmetic so that they could ultimately understand differential equations in modular arithmetic and therefore understand cohomology of graphs of functions in modular arithmetic Unfortunately this vision encounters a large difficulty at the very start In normal calculus the only functions whose derivative is zero are the constant functions But in mod 5 calculus it turns out that nonconstant functions can have derivative zero For instance x5 is certainly a nonzero function but its derivative 5x4 is zero modulo 5 This means that in modular arithmetic simple differential equations have many more solutions than their usual counterparts For example the differential equation dfdx  2fx when solved in normal calculus has solution fx  Cx2 for a constant C But in mod 5 calculus this differential equation has many solutions x2 is one such solution just like in normal calculus but x7 x12 x17  are all solutions as well This means that if you apply de Rhams original procedure to go from differential equations to cohomology you end up getting much much bigger cohomology in modular arithmetic than you do in usual geometry Grothendieck ended up solving this with the theory of crystalline cohomology but it was a big obstacle to overcome  Theres an earlier post I wrote on rmath about homotopical reasoning see   These two posts might seem unrelated at first but surprisingly they are not to do calculus in positive characteristic it turns out you really need homotopical math As an algebraic geometer this was actually my original motivation for learning homotopical thinking For a more down to earth explanation of why do calculus in modular arithmetic  you can check out this article about Hensels lemma   Hensels lemma is a situation where you use Newtons method a great idea from calculus to understand Diophantine equations,user_7729865d,37,0.91,5,2026-02-14 15:07:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1r4yrqo/calculus_in_positive_characteristic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1r4yrqo/calculus_in_positive_characteristic/,True,,self.math,math,False,False,"['calculus', 'like', 'theory', 'certain', 'way']"
1r4fftn,Is my analysis exam easy well balanced or difficult,This is my end of semester analysis I exam and unlike my midterm exam which I have complained about in a previous post for being too calculus like this one feels a bit more analytical What Im asking you is if this is a good exam to test our analysis skills or if its too easy or overly difficult I should clarify something since a lot of you told me last time that my exam had too many computational exercises Im in year 1 of university and in our curriculum there is no calculus course there used to be but then our program was shortened from 4 years to 3 because of the Bologna process so we have to compensate The way we do this is by combining computational exercises that would be appropriate for a calculus exam but requiring very rigorous proofs before you use certain theorems For example before changing a variable you have to create an auxiliary function correctly define it make sure it is continuous and differentiable and then create yet another auxiliary function to substitute your original make sure it has an antiderivative and then you can proceed with your calculation Another way we make it more analytical is by having an oral exam to go along with the written one I personally had to prove the consequences of Lagranges theorem and then use the theorem to find the interval for which a function was constant I also had to write the converse of the theorem and prove if it was true or not but I couldnt because I got very late for the exam and didnt have time so I got a 810 One things for sure Im never going to any club in the next 5 years and Im never going to do this stupid thingnot even looking at my courses and leaving everything to the last 2 weeks,user_f4b2da06,275,0.9,63,2026-02-14 00:29:19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r4fftn,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1r4fftn/is_my_analysis_exam_easy_well_balanced_or/,False,,reddit.com,math,False,False,"['calculus', 'function', 'analysis', 'theorem', 'way']"
1qoxwdt,State of the Subreddit January 2027 Mods applications and rules updates,tldr mods applications and minor rules changes Also its 2026 lol Hello fellow programs Its been a while since Ive checked in and I wanted to give an update on the state of affairs I wont be able to reply to every single thing but Ill do my best  Mods applications I know theres been some frustration about moderation resources so first things first I want to open up applications for new mods for rprogramming If youre interested please start by reading the State of the Subreddit May 2024 post for the reasoning behind the current rulesets then leave a comment below with the word application somewhere in it so that I can tell it apart from the memes In there please give at least  Why you want to be a mod  Your favouriteleast favourite kinds of programming content here or anywhere else  What youd change about the subreddit if you had a magic wand ignoring feasibility  Reddit experience new user 10 year veteran spez himself and moderation experience if any Im looking to pick up 1020 new mods if possible and then Ill be looking to them to first help clean the place up mainly just keeping the new page free of rulebreaking content and then for feedback on changes that we could start making to the rules and content mix Ive been procrastinating this for a while so wish me luck Well probably make some mistakes at first so try to give us the benefit of the doubt  Rules update Not much is changing about the rules since last time except for a few things most of which I said last time I was keeping an eye on   Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming Its gotten out of hand and our users hate it I thought it was a brief fad but its been 2 years and its still going   Newsletters I tried to work with the frequent fliers for these and literally zero of them even responded to me so were just going to do away with the category   I made this previously called demos with code These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo It was previously allowed when it was at least a GitHub link because sometimes people discussed the technical details of the code on display but these days even the code dumps are just people showing off something they worked on Thats cool but its not programming content  The rules With all of that here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place  means that its currently allowed  means that its not currently allowed  means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early  means that Im not making a ruling on it today but its a category were keeping an eye on   Actual programming content They probably have actual code in them Language or library writeups papers technology descriptions How an allocator works How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works How our startup built our Frobnicator For many years this was the only category of allowed content   Academic CS or programming papers   Programming news ChatGPT can write code A big new CVE just dropped Curl 801 released now with Coffee over IP support   Programmer career content How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days Habits of the best engineering managers These must be related or specific to programmingsoftware engineering careers in some way   Articlesnews interesting to programmers but not about programming Work from home is bullshit Return to office is bullshit Theres a Steam sale on programming games Terry Davis has died How to SCRUMM App Store commissions are going up How to hire a more diverse development team Interviewing programmers is broken   General technology news Google buys its last competitor A self driving car hit a pedestrian Twitter is collapsing Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment Meta cancels work from home Gnome dropped a feature I like How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of uh cats yeah its definitely just for cats A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local   Anything clearly written mostly by an LLM If you dont want to write it we dont want to read it   Politics The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden Please vote for net neutrality Big Tech is being sued in Europe for gestures broadly Grace Hopper Conference is now 60 male   Gossip Richard Stallman switches to Windows Elon Musk farted Linus Torvalds was a poopyhead on a mailing list The Peoples Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form Stack Overflow sucks now Stack Overflow is good actually   Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming Its gotten out of hand and our users hate it   Newsletters Listicles or anything else that just aggregates other content If you found 15 open source projects that will blow my mind post those 15 projects instead and well be the judge of that   Demos without code I wrote a game come buy it Please give me feedback on my startup totally not an ad nosirree I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor heres the pricing page I made a DALLE image generator I made the fifteenth animation of A this week heres a GIF   Project demos I made this Previously called demos with code These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo   Project technical writups I made this and heres how As said above true technical writeups of a codebase or demonstrations of a technique or samples of interesting code in the wild are absolutely welcome and encouraged All links to projects must include what makes them technically interesting not just what they do or a feature list or that you spent all night making it The technical writeup must be the focus of the post not just a tickbox checking exercise to get us to allow it This is a technical subreddit not Product Hunt We dont care what you built we care how you build it   AskReddit type forum questions Whats your favourite programming language Tabs or spaces Does anyone else hate it when   Support questions How do I write a web crawler How do I get into programming Wheres my missing semicolon Please do this obvious homework problem for me Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because theyd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low   Surveys and  Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself   Meta posts DAE think rprogramming sucks Why did you remove my post Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear Im just asking questions Except this meta post This one is okay because Im a tyrant that the rules dont apply to I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now   Images memes anything loweffort or lowcontent Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so theres not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because its easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper   Posts that wed normally allow but that are obviously unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copypasted onto a site with a bazillion ads It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if theyre the best discussion going on about the news event Theres a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular there are a lot of spammy security blogs that syndicate stories like this   Extreme beginner content What is a variable What is a for loop Making an HTPT request using curl Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged   Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion   Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory  Comments are only very loosely moderated and its mostly  Bots of any kind Beep boop you misspelled misspelled and  Incivility You idiot everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have   vibe coding articles I tried vibe coding you guys is apparently a hot topic right now If theyre contentless well try to be on them under the general quality rule but were leaving them alone for now if they have anything to actually say Were not explicitly banning the category but you are encouraged to vote on them as you see fit   Corporate blogs simply describing their product in the guise of what is an authorisation framework Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it Companies use their blogs as marketing branding and recruiting tools and thats okay when its writing a good article will make people think of us but it doesnt go here if its just a literal advert Usually they are titled in a way that I dont spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments rprogrammings mission is to be the place with the highest quality programming content where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day In general rulefollowing posts will stay up even if subjectively they arent that great We want to default to allowing things rather than intervening on quality grounds except LLM output etc and let the votes take over On rprogramming the voting arrows mean show me more like this We use them to drive rules changes So please vote away Because of this were not especially worried about categories just because they have a lot of very lowscoring posts that sit at the bottom of the hot page and are never seen by anybody If youve scrolled that far its because you went through the higherscoring stuff already and wed rather show you that than show you nothing On the other hand sometimes rulebreaking posts arent obvious from just the title so also dont be shy about reporting rulebreaking content when you see it Try to leave some context in the report reason a lot of spammers report everything else to drown out the spam reports on their stuff so the presence of one or two reports is often not enough to alert us since sometimes everything is reported Theres an unspoken metarule here that the other rules are built on which is that all content should point outward That is it should provide more value to the community than it provides to the poster Anything thats looking to extract value from the community rather than provide it is disallowed even without an explicit rule about it This is what drives the prohibition on job postings surveys feedback requests and partly on support questions Another important metarule is that mechanically its not easy for a subreddit to say well allow 5 of the content to be support questions So for anything that we allow we must be aware of types of content that beget more of themselves Allowing memes and CS student homework questions will pretty quickly turn the subreddit into only memes and CS student homework questions leaving no room for the subreddits actual mission,user_f8b7deef,106,0.93,61,2026-01-27

1r551c8,RO She Was Going To Tell Him Tomorrow,She didnt hide the truth because she was manipulative She hid it because she thought telling him would cost her the best love of her life It did anyway Elara Voss met Julian Reyes on a rainy Thursday in late August 2025 outside a small West Village speakeasy that required a password whispered into a brass lions mouth She was waiting for a friend who never showed He was there because a client had canceled a yacht deal and he needed a drink anyway He offered his umbrella She accepted it Then his name Then a few hours later his bed Julian was thirtyfour A yacht dealer occasional art flipper when boredom hit The kind of man who moved through rooms with quiet certainty and never had to announce his presence Women noticed him He rarely reacted Elara was twentyseven an only child from a quiet Denver suburb She moved to New York chasing modeling work that never quite stabilized OnlyFans began during a financially desperate month in 2023 and by 2024 became her primary income It gave her freedom It also gave her a life she wasnt always proud to explain Subscribers knew her body her humor her carefully written vulnerability They didnt know Julian existed Julian didnt know about the page For six months they were uncomplicatedly happy They flew to Tulum one Friday because he had a meeting that couldve been an email and she had never seen bioluminescent waves They swam at 2 am glowing plankton flickering around their bodies like quiet stars She laughed when a wave knocked him over he pulled her close and kissed the salt from her lips Back in New York the intimacy settled into small rituals instead of grand gestures Tuesday nights meant diner runs at 4 am He ordered burnt grilled cheese She stole his fries and drew hearts in ketchup He taught her chess on his rooftop she beat him twice and he accused her of cheating with strategic distractions She mocked his terrible taste in 80s power ballads while he drove them upstate windows down volume high Every time she walked into a room he would look up like he had been waiting for that exact moment He provided without making it feel transactional  flight upgrades rent quietly labeled for coffee gifts chosen with attention instead of extravagance He was also playful occasionally reckless affectionate in ways that felt grounding rather than overwhelming He made her feel safe and intensely wanted at the same time She almost told him many times The night they got small matching wave tattoos after Tulum The morning he traced her stretch marks and called them beautiful The afternoon he found her crying over harsh comments and simply held her without interrogation Each time the same thought stopped her Hes too good Hell leave I wont survive that So she delayed Posted softer content Angled cameras carefully Hid the necklace he bought her Promised herself she would tell him soon  just not today February 14 2026 They attended a Valentines party at a glass house in the Hamptons Ocean view too many bottles open people performing happiness for each other Julian wore a charcoal suit that fit him effortlessly Elara wore green velvet he once said made her look impossible to ignore They danced casually comfortably like a couple who had forgotten the performance aspect of love People kept telling them they looked perfect together Then a drunk acquaintance clapped Julian on the shoulder Man how do you handle your girl running an OnlyFans Respect Julian laughed lightly She doesnt have one The man showed him his phone Julians expression didnt shift He just looked at the screen a little longer than necessary then excused himself He found Elara at the bar midlaugh midsentence Touched her elbow gently Hey Come outside with me for a second The porch was cold A single yellow light Gravel driveway stretching into dark silence He handed her the phone Her own face smiled back at her  lingerie fairy lights a caption about gratitude Her voice trembled Babe Im so sorry I meant to tell you I swear I tried Every time I wanted to it felt impossible because youre youre everything Julian I kept thinking if I just waited for the right moment He looked at her quietly like he was committing her to memory rather than judging her Youve been great he said softly The gentleness hurt more than anger would have You gave me some of the best experiences of my life Tulum waves Sunrise coffee 4 am diner ketchup hearts The way you laugh when you lose control The way you look at me like I matter more than I probably deserve Ill always love you for that You gave me real happiness He paused But Im not the guy for you Her knees gave out before she processed the words She collapsed onto the wooden boards hands bracing instinctively a sound escaping her that didnt even feel like it belonged to her He crouched brushing hair away from her tearstreaked face I believe youd delete everything tonight if I asked he said gently Burn it all down for me And I still wouldnt stay She clutched his sleeve Please Julian dont He stood looking down at her with something that wasnt anger wasnt contempt  just finality Love you Elara Gravel crunched Car door shut Engine started Taillights faded into darkness She remained on the porch long after the cold seeped through the velvet of her dress whispering his name like repetition could reverse reality Inside laughter and music continued as if nothing irreversible had just happened When she finally stood she didnt go back in She walked to the edge of the driveway and stared at the empty road where his car had disappeared Bottom of Form She whispered to the dark I was going to tell you tomorrow I swear As if that wouldve changed anything Julian went back to his life the way highfunctioning men do  quietly efficiently without spectacle He drank more for a few weeks worked more for a few months and eventually resumed selling yachts to men who loved power more than people He didnt talk about her He didnt spiral He just continued Elara stopped posting for a while The camera felt like an accusation now Food tasted like cardboard Most nights she sat on the floor of her apartment back against the bed scrolling through old photos she never had the courage to delete Time as it always does moved forward without asking their permission They both dated again Met good people Kind people Easier people Julian still loved but more cautiously Less openly Like a man who had once reached too far emotionally and learned the cost of trusting too completely Elara still fell for people but never fully She told herself it was maturity  boundaries growth selfrespect The truth was simpler she never again risked being fully seen They functioned They succeeded Their lives looked normal from the outside Only they knew the quiet truth underneath some heights in life once reached and lost become too dangerous to ever attempt again And so they lived well  just slightly below the altitude where that kind of love exists,user_90588e43,1,1.0,1,2026-02-14

1r4swg3,MF The Necklace,Annie a beautiful young woman who had recently married returned to her childhood home for a brief visit She came from a modest middleclass background where her father a man of quiet wisdom had spent a lifetime mastering the art of financial discipline Though his salary was never grand he provided a stable life through sacrifice He shunned branded clothes expensive electronics and fine dining he never owned a vehicle or took lavish vacations Instead he funneled every spare money into valuebased assetseducation for his children small plots of land and jewellery for his wife However society is often a harsh judge of such simple living To ensure his daughter faced no taunts and that no guest found a reason to complain the father poured his lifes savings into a single day Annies wedding To escape the peoples judgement years of hard work were surrendered to a few hours of celebration Annies mother who had once collected jewellery with quiet pride sold every piece she owned to buy Annie a magnificent diamond necklace Annie had pleaded against it but her mother was terrified of Annies new motherinlaw Mrs Nancy A boastful woman Mrs Nancy had visited before the wedding to flaunt her own wealth pointedly mentioning the three sets of diamond and gold jewelry she had gifted her own daughter Fearing her daughter would be belittled Annies mother sacrificed her own treasures to provide that one sparkling necklace During her visit home the atmosphere was bittersweet Her brother Michaela brilliant analytical mind who had always excelled in his studieshad just received lifechanging news He was offered a prestigious scholarship for higher studies abroad While the tuition was covered the relocation and living expenses were immense Annie overheard her parents whispering late at night The joy in their voices was thin masked by the heavy realization that they had nothing left to give him The wedding had drained the coffers dry Guilt washed over Annie she felt her future had been bought at the cost of her brothers That night Annies behavior took a chilling turn She rose from her bed with a vacant expressionless gaze and marched toward her parents room When they switched on the lights they gasped in terror Annie stood there clutching a kitchen knife in one hand and her diamond necklace in the other Sell it she demanded her voice cold and hollow Her father recognizing the symptoms from her childhood realized she was sleepwalking He tried to soothe her but her reactions grew aggressive and frantic To calm the trance he contacted a local jeweler he knew personally Under the veil of night the jeweler took the necklace in exchange for a significant sum of cash The next morning Annie woke to a hazy room and a lingering sense of exhaustion A doctor had already come and gone When Annie pressed her mother for the truth her father finally confessed the terrifying events of the night He recounted how she had stood before them cold and unrecognizable threatening them with a knife to sell the necklace while lost in a somnambulistic state Annie appeared utterly devastated her face pale as she grappled with the realization of her unconscious actions While her mother fretted over how they would ever explain the missing jewelry to the sharptongued Mrs Nancy a sudden spark of clarity lit up Annies eyes She suggested a compromise she would contact the jeweler to commission a highquality duplicatea piece that looked identical but cost a fraction of the price Her mother remained unconvinced her heart set on reclaiming the original heirloom However her fatherever the pragmatiststepped forward and handed Annie the thick stack of cash He looked her in the eye placing the burden of the future in her hands The choice was now hers she could buy back the diamond original or she could keep the money and find another way forward Five days passed One evening after Annie had gone to bed early her mother was finishing the kitchen chores Suddenly she heard a soft thud from Annies room Heart racing she pushed the door open to find Annie standing by the window wearing that same terrifying blank expression Where is my necklace Annie asked The mother stood frozen unable to find her voice Suddenly the vacancy in Annies eyes vanished replaced by a sharp mischievous glint She let out a soft laugh Im a pretty good actress isnt that right The mother gasped leaning against the doorframe as the truth settled in Sweetheart what did you do with the money from the jeweler Annie smiled warmly the weight finally lifted from her shoulders Michael should go abroad Good night Its getting late,user_26c1aee1,4,0.84,1,2026-02-14 11:03:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r4swg3/mf_the_necklace/,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r4swg3/mf_the_necklace/,True,Misc Fiction,self.shortstories,shortstories,False,False,"['necklace', 'night', 'room', 'stood', 'cold']"
1r5050j,NF Mourning the Living,No one teaches you how to mourn the living Or how to deal with the guilt of knowing how selfish it is to feel this way when many people have it worse Many people have actually lost someone and many people have lost their siblings I havent This fact makes the guilt punish the sorrow I feel and force it deep down inside so I no longer feel like Im going to burst at any moment The guilt reminds me I have no right to feel this way and that I am lucky to still have a sister The guilt helps me continue moving through life helps me pretend I am unbothered But there are times the guilt does not win and gives way to the tears and the heavy feeling in my stomach rises to my throat again and rises higher to my head and takes control of every thought How do you mourn someone that is alive She is here but she is not here Not in the way I know her She is not the girl I picture in my dreams The confident beautiful laughing one that visits me when Im sleeping and apologizes for this whole mess  the one that tells me dont worry shes fine these last few years were all a misunderstanding and that I dont have to feel the rock in my gut anymore In these dreams we hug and we laugh about the absurdity of it all and she reminds me its not real and she is happy and she is ok and she is living a beautiful life But I always wake up And Im faced with reality It hits me in the face again mocking me for my naivety It reminds me that girl is still gone My big sister is not laughing and smiling and she is not full of life I am forced to confront the real image of my sister  the hurt broken anxious version who I hardly recognize at all I know the sister from my dream is still in there but as the years go on its harder and harder to believe that How do you mourn someone that is alive Things get better but they do not get fixed She is no longer as weak as she once was but she is also only the remains of what her illness has taken from her We can no longer joke and laugh as we used to I monitor my words and I curate conversations I dont want anything to break the tension floating in the air but then a small part of me wants only that Her brain is eating away at her body until she is sick and vomiting I say I understand and I try my hardest not to get angry But I am angry This is not what was supposed to happen She is not supposed to be here closed up in my parents house only communicating with the talking heads on her TV Going home is not supposed to mean gearing up for stress and tears and the rock in my stomach to grow even larger Its not supposed to mean dealing with the fact that my family is not happy My family is sad and angry and lost And very scared But no one speaks of these things until the bubble bursts We do the normal things we used to  we watch Jeopardy and we make dinner and we laugh about old memories from Before But she is supposed to have more than Before She is supposed to have stories from now but we all know she doesnt and we all pretend that we dont notice There are two options before us  pretend and keep the peace or speak to the obvious and feel our emotions no matter how difficult they are We always pick the former Thats what weve always done and thats what used to work so no one knows how to suggest we stop now So we talk and we laugh and only when Im alone in bed do I left myself cry I am the strong one I am the one they dont need to worry about I am okay I cannot mourn someone who is still alive,user_ec02df87,1,0.99,1,2026-02-14 16:09:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r5050j/nf_mourning_the_living/,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r5050j/nf_mourning_the_living/,True,Non-Fiction,self.shortstories,shortstories,False,False,"['feel', 'guilt', 'dont', 'mourn', 'im']"
